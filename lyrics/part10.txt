A true love who was something to see  
I had myself a true love  
At least that's what I kept on telling me  
  
The first thing in the morning  
I still try to think of a way to be with him  
Some part of the evening  
And that's the way I live through the day  
  
I had myself a true love, but now he's gone  
And left me for good  
The lord knows I don't hear those back yard  
Whispers going round the neighborhood  
  
There maybe a lot of things I miss  
A lot of things I don't know  
But I do know this, now I ain't got no love  
And once upon a time I had a true love  
  
In the evening, in the doorway  
While I stand there and wait for his coming  
With the house swept and the clothes hung  
And a pot on the stove where I had meal  
  
Where is he while I waste the rising newel?  
Where is he? Why'd he gone so soon?  
Now there ain't no way that it used to be, what now?  
And everybody keeps telling me  
  
There are may be a lot of things I miss  
A lot of things I don't know  
But I do know this now...  
I ain't got no love  
  
And once upon a time I had a true love.

Perfect situations must go wrong  
But this has never yet prevented me  
Wanting far too much for far too long.  
Looking back I could have played it differently  
One of few more moments who can tell  
But it took time to understand the man  
Now at least I know I know him well.  
Wasn't it good? Oh so good  
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine?  
But in the end he needs  
A little bit more than me  
More She needs security  
He needs his fantasy and freedom

No one in your life is with you constantly  
No one is completely on your side  
And though I move my world to be with him  
Still the gap between us is too wide.  
  
Looking back I could have played it differently  
Could have played things some other way.  
Learn about the man before I fell  
I was just a little careless  
But I was ever so much younger then.  
I was so much younger then  
Now at least I know I know him well  
Wasn't it good? Oh so good  
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine  
Isn't it madness he won't be mine?  
Didn't I know how it would go?  
If I knew from the start  
Why am I falling apart?  
Wasn't he fine? Isn't it madness  
He won't be mine?  
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me  
More She needs security  
He needs his Fantasy and freedom

It took time to understand me

Watching choirs singing carols on TV  
I gaze out through my window at a dozen other windows  
Then I plug in my artificial tree  
And like a dream I begin to remember every Christmas I used to know  
A thousand miles away, a million years ago  
I remember sky.  
It was blue as ink  
Or at least I think  
I remember sky  
I remember snow, soft as feathers, sharp as thumbtacks  
Coming down like lint  
And it made you squint when the wind would blow  
And ice like vinyl on the streets  
Cold as silver, white as sheets  
Rain like strings and changing things  
Like leaves  
I remember leaves  
Green as spearmint  
Crisp as paper  
I remember trees  
Bare as coat racks, spread like broken umbrellas  
And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos  
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes  
Light and noise and bees and boys  
And daaaaays, oh!  
I remember days or at least I try  
But as years go by, they're a sort of haze  
And the bluest ink isn't really sky.  
And at times I think I would gladly die  
For a day of sky!

Troubles seem to up and disappear  
You touch me with the love you're bringing  
I can't really lose when you're near, when you're near  
And love, if all my friends have forgotten half their promises  
They're not unkind, just hard to find  
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live  
Without the rest, I found the best

Such a crime against the nation?  
Should I throw her into jail  
Or drown the cat?

Daybreak and I take a glide  
Into the pool of peace inside  
(Two waves travel by)  
To waves and I both travel by  
(And that makes all the difference to me)  
  
Life supporting waves of bliss  
Mother Divine's precious kiss  
Brings with love the light of wisdom  
And the gift of eternal freedom  
  
To waves and I both travel by  
(... and the nature of man...)  
And that makes all the difference to me

Dusk time the shadows fall  
Into the timeless time of all  
  
To waves and I both travel by  
Golden auras glow around you  
Omnipresent love surrounds you  
Wisdom warming as the sun  
You and I are truly one  
  
To waves and I both travel by

At Palisades in Salisbury park the roller coasters are flyin  
At Euclid Beach on the flying turns I'll bet you can't keep her smilin'  
Buy your girl a cotton candy while you're down on the ground  
Then take her on the Twirl-A-Way and spin her around  
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day  
  
The parachutes at Riverview Park will shake us up all day  
And Disneyland and p.o.p. is worth a trip to L.A.  
Watchin' girls in the air can really get you bad  
And I'll bet the laughin' lady makes you laugh like mad  
Let's pick up our friends and do amusement parks USA  
  
Hurry, hurry, hurry folks step right up to the beach boy circus.  
The best little show in town.  
Hurry, hurry, hurry, it's only a dime folks, one thin dime, just one tenth of
a dollar.  
Come on in and see Stella the snake dancer (is it real?)  
She walks, she talks, she wiggles on her belly like a snake.  
(she looks like a fake to me) (let's go see her) (it costs too much)  
Hurry, hurry, hurry folks, come on and see Stella.  
She shimmies, she shakes  
  
You'll crash and burn in the bumper cars at Jersey's Steel Pier  
You'll crack 'em up when you stand in front of all the crazy mirrors  
At first you'll be a chicken at the jackhammer ride  
But you'll do it with a girl sittin' right by your side  
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day

Now the puzzle's laid out on my table  
The pieces don't fit  
I move from chair to chair  
But that empty one's there where she used to sit  
I'm sitting here going out of my mind  
'Cause she's gone away  
She couldn't wait, now I  
I'm afraid it's too late  
I'm waitin' till my angel comes home  
It's been hell bein' here alone  
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home  
Angel, angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel come home  
Oo oo oo angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Does she remember  
That I can't forget  
Does she know I regret  
I never told her how I  
I wanted to hold her  
I just let her go  
Lonely nights thinkin'  
It's starting to sink in  
We had a way to go  
We'll grow closer together  
By being apart  
When my angel comes home  
It's been hell bein' here alone  
God tell me, why has she flown  
So far away  
I pray she won't stay another day  
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home  
Please come home  
Angel, come home  
If you see her tell my angel come home  
Hoo ooo angel, come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Hey hey angel, come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Ho oo angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Hey angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
If you see that girl my angel come home  
Hey hey angel come home

Feed the pigeons in the park near Tour-Eifelle  
Bells are ringing, soul of France  
Bells are singing of romance  
There's a chapel ""Sacre Coure"" in quaint Montmarte  
In the open air the painters show their art  
In the restaurant sip a beaujolies  
What a perfect way to spend a lovely day  
Bells are ringing, soul of France  
Bells are singing of romance  
Sunday morning, hear the bells of Notre Dame  
Watching belles jeunes filles and the handsome gendarmes  
Near the Arc De Triomphe on the Champs-Elysees  
Coffee and croissants in a sidewalk cafe  
Some people go to see the races at Deauville  
Or weekend by the racing tides of Mont San Michelle  
Some take the tour of Chartres on an autobus  
While the writers and the artists never leave Mont Parnasse

His thoughts somehow found their way back  
To remembering the fascinating episode of the night before

And sat in his favorite chair  
Thoughts danced in his head for a while  
""Suppose I went to check and see if my transistor is still down there""

Join the Big Sur river to the oceanside

To learn the truth before my door  
Don't you know

To take all the changes that are always amazin'  
But to never let 'em fence me in

Giving to you can you dig

I can't rely on anyone to sow and grow my seeds

I was a runaway son and now I'm up out of the water  
And I can barely barely breathe

[And fly outside with them]

[That I'm fascinated with the funny music I hear on your radios]  
[You are the first to know of me]  
[You can't see me I'm hidden]  
[But you can see the green glow I make]  
[I heard you laugh last night]  
[I figured that you would be amused by me]  
[Listen to this]  
  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)

Then the prince heard something he never knew could be  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
The hidden Pied Piper was laughing  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
As the prince moved his head back and forth with the music going on  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
When the music died down the Piper said that ""every night  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
After midnight if you leave your on your transistor radio  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)

I'll promise to bring more magic music to you  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)

No one"" he said "" will ever believe you so why tell of me to anyone?  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
You are my only friend of night"" said the Pied Piper ""and I'll talk to  
You again some night""  
  
(Bow bow)  
(I'm the Pied Piper)  
(Bow bow bow bow bow)  
(In the radio)  
  
Then the radio was glowing no more  
As it fell into the hands of the fascinated prince  
He ran back amazed and he hopped right back into bed  
  
That night he dreamt all night  
Mostly about his radio and his friend the Pied Piper  
  
The prince did try what the Piper said to do  
But for weeks at night  
He heard nothing like the music of that magic night  
  
""That Pied Piper must have been joking"" he said  
""There's nothing but Bach on this radio  
I'm gonna throw it back up in the attic for good""  
This he sat disbelieving the young prince so loud  
That two of his brothers overheard him  
The next day those two brothers took the radio from the attic and turned  
It on  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
There it was the music had to be from the Pied Piper himself  
  
(My radio is radiatin' through the)  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
(Through the misty night)  
(Through the misty night)  
  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
(My radio is radiatin' through the)  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
(Through the misty night)  
(Through the misty night)  
  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
The prince's sisters ran in their brother's room  
(My radio is radiatin' through the)  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
And they were all dancing and screaming with joy  
(Through the misty night)  
(Through the misty night)  
But the transistor was playing too loud  
  
And their mother heard it  
(Dom dom kingdom)  
""What are you doing there? What is that you're listening too?  
Give me that radio at once"" she said

Sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days  
When your friends have all gone  
Leaving this town for another one  
The night is coming round

So afraid to lose this dream  
I want you to understand that I'm trying to do the best I can  
It's so easy to lose my way  
Lay your head where you may find some peace  
I've been searching for my happiness  
Don't you want to wake up and take my love,  
I'd be happy if you'd let me know  
Should I stay or go  
Let me know  
Woke from a dream to see reflections all around me,  
Of new realities,  
Heavenly angels won't you guide me  
Please help me to decide the path most  
Meant for me.

Lots of girls running through my brain tonight  
Male ego is played by all  
Chasing ladies and having a ball  
Hey girl, I'm gonna give you a call tonight  
Don't know why we love to chase those tasty ladies  
Betcha boys we'll be doing it in our eighties  
Male ego's like a game of chance  
The gamble starts with just a glance  
You're off and running with a new romance tonight  
Male ego won't ever quit  
It seems to me from where I sit  
We oughta do our bit to capture it tonight  
You look nice  
What's your name?  
You smell nice  
What's your name?  
I like you  
What's your name?  
I like you  
What's your name?  
You look nice  
What's your name?

She don't want to hold me (oh, no!)  
And kiss my lips anymore  
She's gonna leave me  
And she don't believe me  
That I'll be true now  
  
Well maybe she don't love me  
And is not thinkin' of me  
But why'd she do it this time of year?  
She knows that I'll miss her  
And I'll want to kiss her  
If just for Christmas

Merry Christmas, baby  
Merry Christmas, baby  
Merry Christmas, baby  
  
Tell me, what did I do  
To really convince you  
That I'm not the guy anymore?  
Take back my ring now  
I'll do anything now  
But please forgive me  
  
I made my mistake but  
I'm willing to wake up  
And never mess around anymore  
Oh why did we break up?  
There's still time to make up  
If just for Christmas

Beach Boys,Monster Mash,/b/beach+boys/monster+mash_20013683.html,"I was working in the lab, late one night  
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight  
For my monster from his slab, began to rise  
And suddenly to my surprise  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
From my laboratory in the castle east  
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast  
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes  
To get a jolt from my electrodes  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They did the mash , it caught on in a flash  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
If you've ever seen a monster before  
Dancin' across the dance floor  
Don't be afraid, don't run and shout  
Turn around and help the monster turn it out  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
And if you don't have core hard cash  
You can still do the monster mash  
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds  
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds  
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive  
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring  
Seems he was troubled by just one thing  
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said  
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash  
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band  
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land  
For you, the living this mash was meant too  
When you get to my door, tell them Borris sent you  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash  
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash
