Beautiful South,Blackbird On The Wire,/b/beautiful+south/blackbird+on+the+wire_20015231.html,"Eyes to take you dancing  
Mouth to leave your wife  
Legs to run away with  
And you wonder why?  
  
Heart that makes you bypass  
Every other girl  
Smile that keeps you grinning  
At the madness of this world  
  
But like the blackbird on the wire  
I will not take the prey on you  
You wouldn't want me to  
For I am too soft for such a thing  
And like the blackbird on the wire  
I just watch you by  
The tears I knew I'd cry  
Fall unnoticed down below  
  
Front to make you happy  
Back to make you weep  
Lips to keep you kissing  
Whilst everyone's asleep  
  
Tears to break a backbone  
Laughs to win a war  
And people come and ask me  
What I love you for  
  
But like the blackbird on the wire  
I will not take the prey on you  
You wouldn't want me to  
For I am too soft for such a thing  
And like the blackbird on the wire  
I just watch you by  
The tears I knew I'd cry  
Fall unnoticed down below  
  
And with a tongue built from quicksilver  
And a character of steel  
They actually come and ask me  
How I feel  
  
But like the blackbird on the wire  
I will not take the prey on you  
You wouldn't want me to  
For I am too soft for such a thing  
And like the blackbird on the wire

Drinking ice-cold lagers, living in Spanish castles

In white ankle socks and pink Bermuda shorts

Chained our ideal home to bicycle shed  
Clamped our racing car before we sat in driver's seat  
Tied our shooting stars and wrapped them round a tree  
  
We could've courted Einstein  
Could've courted Marx  
We could've gone for strolls  
Like other families do in parks  
Son you were born a dud  
In a family without sparks  
Yes you've got those chicken wings  
You just can't fly  
  
The checkered flag  
That losers despise  
Never flew in our port  
Or harbored in our eyes  
Cause we always formed that queue  
For second prize  
This family's got those chicken wings  
We just can't fly  
  
Our winning tickets ripped up into shreds  
The tale of this family, is its heads  
We're bouncing on a pogo stick  
Without any springs  
It hurts me to admit this  
But we've got those chicken wings  
  
Yes you've got those chicken wings  
And all the luggage that the failure brings  
Is a swallow flying high that sings  
Look he's got those chicken wings

And I say go to hell, 'cause that's where you took me

And, when I'm with her I realise what love can be  
Because she's fifty times the person you'll ever be

Since you've been gone the offers have been everywhere

I was gonna spread the news of the way I always lose  
But my pen ran out  
So I'll keep an envelope with all the words I should have said  
Hide it in a tiny box underneath my bed  
And written on the outside will be 'open when he's dead'  
And written on the outside will be 'open when he's dead'

In a knot, in a knot

Till the General said 'I'm sorry you've been framed'

At a video bloodbath  
And nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
Keep those entries coming  
Leave those cameras running  
Keep those entrails coming  
Leave those soldiers gunning  
Because you're sure to get a laugh  
With a video bloodbath  
Nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
Here's a wacky video we got last week  
A bomb catches Arthur unawares  
He's lost both his arms and he can't see or speak  
But thank you for the memory you shared  
  
Cause the rulers always laugh  
At a video bloodbath  
And nothing gets a laugh  
Like a video bloodbath  
  
Keep those entries coming  
Leave those cameras running  
Keep those entrails coming  
Leave those soldiers gunning

Beauty And The Beast,Tale As Old As Time,/b/beauty+and+the+beast/tale+as+old+as+time_20544034.html,"[Intro]  
Tale as old as time  
True as it can be  
Barely even friends  
Then somebody bends  
Unexpectedly  
  
[Verse 1]  
Just a little change  
Small to say the least  
Both a little scared  
Neither one prepared  
Beauty and the beast  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ever just the same  
Ever a surprise  
Ever as before  
Ever just as sure  
As the sun will rise  
  
[Chorus]  
Tale as old as time  
Tune as old as song  
  
[Verse 2]  
Bitter sweet and strange  
Finding you can change  
Learning you were wrong  
  
[Bridge]  
Certain as the sun  
Rising in the east  
  
[Chorus]  
Tale as old as time  
Song as old as rhyme  
Beauty and the beast x2  
  
[Outro]  
Off to the cupboard with you Chip it's past your bed time  
Goodnight love

Beauty And The Beast,Theres Something There,/b/beauty+and+the+beast/theres+something+there_20598803.html,"Belle:  
There's something sweet  
And almost kind  
But he was mean  
And he was course  
And unrefined  
And now he's dear  
And so I'm sure  
I wonder why I didn't see it there before  
  
Beast:  
She glanced this way  
I thought I saw  
And when we touched  
She didn't shudder at my paw  
No it can't be  
I'll just ignore  
But then she's never looked at me that way before  
  
Belle:  
New and a bit alarming  
Who'd have ever thought that this could be  
True that he's no prince charming  
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see  
  
Lumiere:  
Well who'd have thought  
  
Ms. Potts:  
Well bless my soul  
  
Cogsworth:  
Well who'd have known  
  
Ms. Potts:  
Well who indeed  
  
Lumiere:  
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own  
  
Ms. Potts:  
It's so peculiar  
  
Ms. Potts, cogsworth, lumiere  
We'll wait and see a few days more  
There may be something there that wasn't there before

People laugh and people cry.  
Every morning the clock strikes eight.  
I go to work.  
I close the gate.  
And on my way, I sing a song.  
About my wife, where I belong.  
  
If the clouds get together and talk about the weather  
If it's rain they anticipate  
Baby make no mistake  
Yes the storm will break but never me you see.  
Two years on two years on  
But only you can see me.  
Only you can see me.  
  
For what I've got  
Sir Lancelot was just a dream and I am not  
For I am he with something more  
It's you and I reality.  
  
If the cloud get together and talk about the weather  
If it's rain they anticipate  
Baby, make no mistake  
Yes the storm will break but never me you see  
Two years on two years on

Only you can see me

Turn the tide

You disappear into the crowd  
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came  
But I still call your name out loud  
I want to know you , but I never met you  
Reality can be cruel  
If a wandering soul meets another  
They shouldn't be separated  
Better in love with your head on my shoulder  
But I'll never be satisfied  
And if I can't see you  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
When love goes wrong, only love knows why  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Living your life in someone else's heart  
A lover's dream that has no end  
There may be somebody you can base your world upon  
I'll never be the same again  
And there's a part of me here  
And there's a part of me with you  
But all of me loves you  
Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me  
I'm so proud of  
All of my days I will be here for you  
And the love keeps running  
And if I can't hold you  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
And there's a million words for the one goodbye  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I  
  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
And there's a million words for the one goodbye  
Life goes on for the lonely man  
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons  
You and I, I

But be alive, I know that we will.  
The world keeps on moving but I'm holding still.  
  
In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny.  
That would arrive the moment you're born.  
For we will be here when the miracle comes.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Living eyes when under the sun don't cry.  
No war in my mind.  
The state of my heart.  
Living eyes when out in the rain will fall.  
The day I deny the face of my love.  
  
[Bridge:]  
We are of age, we are in time, we are forever.  
Right now when the power is mine.  
I leave you Heaven and the Earth, I leave you never.  
And living to love is the reason to shine.  
  
I been over I been under I don't own a dream to analyze.  
But living eyes you know that I do.  
Believe in the soul and the magic of you.

'N sat on the side of the bed  
He said, ""I'm leaving you, baby""

I said, ""I can't make you stay if you want to go  
But it's high time, baby, that you should know  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
So, if you still want to go, go ahead""  
And I mean every word I said  
  
My baby thought I was jivin'  
And he went right out the door  
He left me about three in the morning  
I got me a man at four  
Some women cry when their men bleed 'em  
Dry, long and slow  
But I found out somethin' a long time ago  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
So if he gets too big for his pants  
You better spring that new one and give him a chance  
  
I used to be chicken hearted  
Cry when he'd walk out the door  
'Cause I was just young and stupid  
Ha! Ain't like that no more  
'Cause I had a hard way to go  
But I learned the score  
And I'm here to tell you  
  
One monkey don't stop no show  
One monkey don't stop no show  
Let him do anything he choose  
There's a million men who can fill his shoes

Bette Midler,Only In Miami,/b/bette+midler/only+in+miami_20017048.html,"Walking along the beach last night  
Who do you think I spy?  
A girl with ebony fire eyes.  
Soft and low do she cry.  
Now what could be such a source of pain?  
I so boldly inquire.  
Pointing finger Havana way,  
These three words which transpire:  
  
She told me that only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
Only in Miami.  
My story, she goes this way.  
Fish may fly through the purple keys,  
Golden birds take to air.  
I am bound to the earth, it seems.  
My life can be so unfair.  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
  
Standing on the shoreline waiting,  
Everyone anticipating.  
I can hear the broken hearted say,  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
  
And she cries for her child without a mother.  
And she cries for her son without a father.  
And she cries for herself without a lover.  
Can't face another day.  
Chase the blues away.  
I thought I heard her mumble as she  
Turned away  
  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
  
Standing on the shoreline waiting,  
Everyone anticipating.  
I can hear the broken hearted say,  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away.

Only in Miami

And the pavements were steaming  
  
I told Billy Ray in his red Chevrolet

And it started to swelter  
Sweat trickled down the front of her gown  
And I thought it would melt her  
  
She threw back her hair like I wasn't there  
And she sipped on a Julep  
Her shoulders were bare and I tried not to stare  
When I looked at her two lips  
  
And then she looked at me, I heard her softly say  
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say  
But stay with me until the sun has gone away  
And I will chase the boy in you away  
  
And then she smiled and we talked for a while  
Then we walked for a mile to the sea  
We sat on the sand and a boy took her hand  
But I saw the sunrise as a man  
  
Ten years have gone by since I looked in her eye  
But the memory lingers  
I go back in my mind to the very first time  
And feel the touch of her fingers
