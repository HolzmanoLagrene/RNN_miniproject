"The folks who live on the hill.""  
  
Someday we may be adding  
A thing or two, a wing or two.  
We will make changes as any family will.  
But we will always be called  
""The folks who live on the hill.""  
  
Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,  
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.  
And when the kids grow up and leave us,  
We'll sit and look at the same old view, just we two.  
  
Darby and Joan who, used to be Jack and Jill,  
The folks like to be called  
What they have always been called,  
""The folks who live on the hill.""

Bette Midler,The Rose,/b/bette+midler/the+rose_20017078.html,"Some say love, it is a river, that drowns the tender reed  
Some say love, it is a razor, that leaves your soul to bleed  
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need  
I say love, it is a flower, and you, it's only seed  
  
It's the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance  
It's the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance  
It's the one who won't be taken, who can not seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live  
  
When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong  
Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snow  
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose.

Makes me feel so blue  
  
My man wouldn't give me no breakfast  
Wouldn't give me no dinner  
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors  
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes  
I didn't have so many  
But I had a long, long way to go  
  
Some men like me talkin' happy  
Some calls it snappy  
Some call me honey  
Others think I got money

Makes me everthing a good man needs

But I should never think of Spring  
For that would surely break my heart in two

Should I fall once more  
No, it's best that I stick to my tune  
  
I get along without you very well  
Of course, I do

They would go hot cha

Summer, fall and spring  
But for seven silly reasons  
Someone pulled the string  
And they started dancing  
Now they call it swing

Someone occupies your embrace

Watching the tube  
Telling myself, she still may DROP

With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand  
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood

He sits in a room with a lock on the door  
With his maps and his medals laid out of the floor  
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.  
  
I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage,  
I've found that just surviving was a noble fight  
I once believed in causes too, had my pointless point of view  
Life went on no matter who was wrong or right.  
  
And there's always a place for the angry young man  
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand  
He's never been able to learn from mistakes  
He can't understand why his heart always breaks  
He's honest and pure and has courage as well  
He's fair and he's true, and he's boring as hell  
And he'll go to his grave as an angry old man.

In hell there's a big hotel  
Where the bar just closed and the windows never open  
No phone so you can't call home  
And the TV works, but the clicker is broken  
But in the darkness I see your light turned on  
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to

Blonde over blue  
They shine as though you're burning inside  
One word from you is all I need to be inspired

These days there's a million ways  
To be pulled and torn, to be misdirected  
These times there are sins and crimes  
On the morning shows for the disconnected  
I look and I write my book  
And I walk away with the wrong impressions  
I don't care 'cause I've done my share  
And I need some time for my own obsessions  
It doesn't matter, I've let that life go by  
It's been forgotten 'cause all I wanted was you  
CHORUS  
These days not a damn soul prays  
And there is no faith 'cause there's nothing to believe in  
These days only good luck pays  
If we don't get paid then we try to get even

And I have my say and I draw conclusions

Maybe you will find familiar  
Maybe you won't understand  
The man's name I don't remember  
He was always Joe to me  
But I can't forget the woman  
She was always Christie Lee  
He was working in a night club  
That's where he played the saxophone  
He used to fake to stock arrangements  
He left the customers alone  
But one night before the last song  
About a quarter after three  
He saw her standing at the coat check  
And made his move on Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
She was a nice piece of music  
She had a rhythm all her own  
He blew a solo like a blind man  
She really dug his saxophone  
She wanted more than just an encore  
And he could play in every key  
He left the stage and packed his alto  
And took it home with Christie Lee  
Oh I heard the man knew ""the Bird"" like the Bible  
You know the man could blow an educated axe  
He couldn't see that Christie Lee was a woman  
Who didn't need another lover  
All she wanted was the sax  
It took a while for him to notice  
It took a while for him to see  
He was never in control here  
It was always Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee  
Oh the man took a calculated gamble  
Yes the man had the power to perform  
But Christie Lee was more than he knew how to handle  
She didn't need him as a man  
All she wanted was the horn  
They say that Joe became a wino  
They say he always drinks alone  
They say he stumbles like a blind man  
They say he sold his saxophone  
Even the band must face the music  
That's what the moral is to me  
The only time you hit the high note  
Is when you play for Christie Lee  
Christie Lee, Christie Lee

Rich man, poor man, either way American  
Shoved into the lost and found  
The no-nukes yell we're gonna all go to hell  
With the next big meltdown  
I got remote control and a color T.V.  
I don't change channels so they must change me  
I got real close friends that will get me high  
They don't know how to talk and they ain't gonna try  
I shouldn't bitch, I shouldn't cry  
I'd start a revolution but I don't have time  
I don't know why I'm still a nice guy  
But I'm getting close to the borderline  
Close to the borderline  
  
I thought I'd sacrificed so many things  
I thought I'd thrown them all away  
I didn't think I needed anything  
But you can't afford to squander what you're not prepared to pay  
  
I need a doctor for my pressure pills  
I need a lawyer for my medical bills  
I need a banker to finance my home  
But I need security to back my loan  
It isn't new what I'm going through  
But everybody knows you got to break sometime  
Another night I fought the good fight  
But I'm getting closer to the borderline  
Closer to the borderline

Billy Joel,Code Of Silence,/b/billy+joel/code+of+silence_20073000.html,"Everybody's got a million questions  
Everybody wants to know the score  
What you went through  
It's something you  
Should be over now  
Everybody wants to hear the secrets  
That you never told a soul before  
And it's not that strange  
Because it wouldn't change  
What happened anyhow  
But you swore to yourself a long time ago  
There were some things that people never needed to know  
Guess there's one that you keep  
That you bury so deep  
No one can tear it out  
And you can't talk about it  
Because you're following a code of silence  
You're never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
And you can't talk about it  
And isn't that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When you've really got a lot to say  
You don't want to lose a friendship  
There's nothing that you have to hide  
And a little dirt  
Couldn't hurt no one anyway  
And you still have a rage inside you  
That you carry with a certain pride  
In the only part of the broken heart  
That you could ever save  
But you've been through it once  
You know how it ends  
You don't see the point  
Of going through it again  
And this ain't the place  
And this ain't the time  
And neither's any other day  
So you can't talk about it  
Because you're following a code of silence  
You're never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
So you can't talk about it  
And isn't that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When you've really got a lot to say  
I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons  
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break  
Some things unknown are best left alone forever  
And if a vow is what it takes  
Haven't you paid for your mistakes  
After the moment passes  
And the impulse disappears  
You can still hold back  
Because you don't crack very easily  
It's a time honored resolution  
Because the danger is always near  
It's with you now  
But that ain't how it was supposed to be  
And it's hard to believe after all these years  
That it still gives you pain and it still brings tears  
And you feel like a fool  
Because it's part of your rules  
You've got a memory  
But you can't talk about it  
Because you're following a code of silence  
You're never gonna to lose the anger  
You just deal with it a different way  
But you can't talk about it  
And isn't that a kind of madness  
To be living by a code of silence  
When you've really got a lot to say

Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?

You best bet's a true baby blue Continental  
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk  
It's still rock and roll to me.  
  
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers  
Cause it's always been the same old scene  
There's a new band in town  
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...  
Aimed at your average teen.  
  
How about a pair of pink sidewinders  
And a bright orange pair of pants?  
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby  
If you just give it half a chance  
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers  
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers  
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways  
It's still rock and roll to me.  
  
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?  
Don't you know that they're out of touch?

An ice cold beer in the shade

Ain't it wonderful to be alive

Billy Joel,Leave A Tender Moment Alone,/b/billy+joel/leave+a+tender+moment+alone_20072868.html,"Even though I'm in love  
Sometimes I get so afraid  
I'll say something so wrong  
Just to have something to say  
  
I know the moment isn't right  
To tell the girl a comical line  
To keep the conversation light  
I guess I'm just frightened out of my mind  
  
But if that's how I feel  
Then it's the best feeling I've even known  
It's undeniably real  
Leave a tender moment alone  
  
Yes I know I'm in love  
But just when I ought to relax  
I put my foot in my mouth  
'Cause I'm just avoiding the facts  
  
If the girl gets too close  
If I need some room to escape  
When the moment arose  
I'd tell her it's all a mistake  
  
But that's not how I feel  
No that's not the woman I've known  
She's undeniably real  
So leave a tender moment alone  
  
But it's not only me  
Breaking down when the tension gets high  
Just when I'm in a serious mood  
She is suddenly quiet and shy  
  
Leave a tender moment  
Leave it alone  
  
I know the moment isn't right  
To hold my emotions inside  
To change the attitude tonight  
I've run out of places to hide  
  
And if that's how I feel  
Then it's the best feeling I've even known  
It's undeniably real  
Leave a tender moment alone

Billy Joel,Modern Woman,/b/billy+joel/modern+woman_20073002.html,"You see her sitting with her coffee and her paper  
With her high top sneakers of Italian design  
With a long cool stare she aggravates the tension  
Makes up her face while she makes up her mind  
  
Now you're in trouble, maybe she's an intellectual  
What if she figures out you're not very smart  
Or maybe she's the quiet type who's into heavy metal  
Boy, you got to get it settled  
Cause she's breaking your heart  
  
Don't try to put on an act  
You can't do that to a modern woman  
And you're an old fashioned man  
She understands the things you're doin'  
She's a modern woman  
  
She looks sleek and she seems so professional  
She's got a lot of confidence, it's easy to see  
You want to make a move  
But you feel so inferior  
Cause under that exterior  
Is someone who's free  
  
She's got style and she's got her own money  
So she's not another honey you can quickly disarm  
She's got the eyes that make you realize  
She won't be hypnotized by your usual charm  
  
You've got your plan of attack  
That won't attract the modern woman  
And you're an old fashioned man  
She understands the things you're doin'  
She's a modern woman  
  
Time goes by and you're sharing an apartment  
She says she loves you but she doesn't know why  
In the morning she leaves you with your coffee and your paper  
It's a strange situation for an old fashioned guy  
  
But times have changed  
Things are not the same, baby  
You overcame such a bad attitude  
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks  
And nowadays it's politics  
And after 1986 what else could we do?  
  
You got to learn to relax  
And face the facts of modern woman  
And you're an old fashioned man  
She understands the things you're doin'  
She's a modern woman

Were still a recent surprise  
And we were flying over  
Scandinavian Skies  
We climbed towards the sun  
We turned and cursed as one  
We pulled the shades  
And closed our eyes  
The Stockholm city lights  
Were slowly starting to rise  
And we were strapped against  
Those Scandinavian skies  
The landing gear came down  
And touched the Swedish ground  
And we were all so paralyzed  
On the plane  
We were mainly sound and lights  
In the veins  
We could play the blues all night  
The tour of Germany  
Was bleeding into our eyes  
And we were sailing over  
Scandinavian skies  
We had the Midas touch  
Until we met the Dutch  
And they exhausted our supplies  
Who's to pay?  
For this international flight  
Who could stay  
We were only there for the night  
We watched the power fall  
Inside the Olso hall  
While all the cold Norweigians cried  
Who could say  
What was left and where was right?  
By the way  
I could play the blues all night

But I can only stand apart and sympathize  
For we are always what our situations hand us  
It's either sadness or euphoria  
  
So we'll argue and we'll compromise  
And realize that nothing's ever changed  
For all our mutual experience  
Our separate conclusions are the same  
  
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity  
Our reason coexists with our insanity  
Though we choose between reality and madness  
It's either sadness or euphoria  
  
How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies  
Perhaps we'll help fulfill each other's fantasies  
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives with our respective similarities  
It's either sadness or euphoria

Some words aren't heard 'til after they're spoken  
Your role was protective, your soul was too defective  
Some people just don't have a heart to be broken

We could've gone all the way to the Great Wall of China  
If you only had a little more faith in me  
In lieu of diamonds, gold, and platinum  
reminders will still shine bright  
All the king's men and all the king's horse  
Can't put you together the way you used to be  
We could have been standing on the Great Wall Of China

Billy Joel,This Is The Time,/b/billy+joel/this+is+the+time_20072932.html,"We walked on the beach beside that old hotel  
They're tearing it down now  
But it's just as well  
I haven't shown you everything a man can do  
So stay with me baby  
I've got plans for you  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
Cause we won't  
Although we'll want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
You've given me the best of you  
And now I need the rest of you  
  
Did you know that before you came into my life  
It was some kind of miracle that I survived  
Some day we will both look back  
And have to laugh  
We lived through a lifetime  
And the aftermath  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
Cause we won't  
Although we want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
I know we've got to move somehow  
But I don't want to lose you know  
  
Sometimes it's so easy  
To let a day  
Slip on by  
Without even seeing each other at all  
But this is the time you'll turn back and so will I  
And those will be the days you can never recall  
  
And so we embrace again  
Behind the dunes  
This beach is cold  
On winter afternoons  
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun  
I'm warm from the memory of days to come  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
But we won't  
Although we'll want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
You've given me the best of you

Then you go away and you're gone all day

Darling all you've got to be is you

When your day is done  
You can see when you look at me,

But you can't let them see you cry  
It's a fact of life, now man and wife  
Work full time to just get by  
And when we're home all  
It's gonna be is me and you  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
I've done some strange things I  
Never thought I'd do before  
But if the strain brings happiness,  
More or less.  
More or less.  
  
Then I don't mind masquerading  
With all those other fools  
I don't mind the games I'm playing,  
Because I've learned the rules  
And when times are tough, I've got just enough  
If you're standing right by my side  
Darling more and more I get hungry for  
All the ways you keep me satisfied  
On our own there ain't nothing  
That we can't get through  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
Then I don't mind masquerading with all those other fools  
I don't mind the games I'm playing,  
Because I've learned the rules  
It doesn't matter when we're home, all alone  
All we've got to be is me and you  
On our own there ain't nothing  
That we can't get through  
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do  
  
Swing that hammer and break that stone  
Push those buttons and answer that phone  
Coffee in the morning and martinis at night  
Everybody's working up a big appetite  
Do as the Romans do.

Bing Crosby,Frosty The Snowman,/b/bing+crosby/frosty+the+snowman_20528342.html,"Frosty, the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty, the snowman is a fairy tale, they say  
He was made of snow but the children know  
That he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Oh Frosty, the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Thumpetty, thump, thump, thumpety, thump, thump  
Look at Frosty go, thumpetty thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump, over the hills of snow  
  
Frosty, the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun  
Now, before I melt away""  
  
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand  
Runnin' here and there, all around the square  
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can""  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
He only paused a moment  
When he heard him holler, ""Stop""  
  
Because ol' Frosty, the snowman, he had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin', ""Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day, I'll be back again some day  
I'll be back again some day""

Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day  
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly Father, a blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name

Papa Bing (yeah Louis)  
I stopped by your place a time or two lately  
And you aren't home either  
Well, I'm a busy man Louis. I got a lotta deals cookin'  
I was probably tied up at the studio  
You weren't tied up you dog  
You was just plain old

Gary)  
Cows need milkin' in the barn (I have the twins on that detail, they each take
a side)  
But you just don't give a darn (give 'em four bits a cow and hand lotion)  
You just never seem to learn (man, you taught me)  
You ain't got no ambition (you're convincin' me)

Got your hound dog by your side (that's old Cindy-Lou goin' with me)  
Gone fishin' (mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm)  
Fleas are bitin' at his hide (get away from me boy, you bother me)

Though many, many times I see  
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.

To where your heart will feel no pain  
And when the fields are fresh and green  
I'll take you to your home again!  
  
To that dear home beyond the sea  
My Kathleen shall again return.  
And when thy old friends welcome thee  
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.  
Where laughs the little silver stream  
Beside your mother's humble cot  
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam  
There all your grief will be forgot.

Way you're acting lately makes me doubt  
Youse is still my baby, baby  
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

Just when you're sure of what you'll find  
She's gone and made a change

Just couldn't fall till we met  
  
It had to be you, it had to be you  
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who  
Could make me be true, could make me be blue  
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you  
  
Some others I've seen might never be mean  
Might never be cross or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do  
For nobody else gave me a thrill  
With all your faults, I love you still  
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you

Bing Crosby,It's The Natural Thing To Do,/b/bing+crosby/its+the+natural+thing+to+do_20528325.html,"When a bird young and free  
Hangs around a certain tree  
Singing serenades that tell his love is true  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
And when a cat on a fence  
Keeps his darling in suspense  
And he's brave enough to face a well-aimed shoe  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
And you know every dove  
Has its heart set on love  
Rabbits, too, pet and pat  
And there's nothing wrong with that  
  
When a boy such as I  
Tries so hard to qualify  
With a very lovely lady such as you  
Can't you see it's the natural thing to do  
  
And then the girl she acts demure  
The boy he feels proud and sure  
So proud and sure that he impulsively suggests a rendezvous  
Fine thing  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
But the girl she just won't agree  
She whimpers and she simpers  
And he begs on bended knee  
But she runs away because she knows full well he'll pursue  
The chump  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
Then the boy in despair  
Waves his arms, tears his hair  
Stamps his feet and he acts like mad  
Then you know that he's got it bad  
  
Then the girl she ought to fall  
If she's got a heart at all  
She should take him in her arms  
And kiss him too  
Oh! Oh! Just the natural thing to do

It's my universe  
Even with an empty purse  
Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams

For a road where nature trods  
And I calculate that I'm worth my weight  
In goldenrods

Lay way back you cats, Dig in  
Live a while, yes, Mr Mack is movin' in  
  
Though the shark has, pretty teeth, dear  
And he shows 'em pearly whites  
Just a jackknife has MacHeath, dear  
And he keeps it, well out of sight  
  
When the shark bites, with his teeth, dear  
Scarlet billows start to spread  
Fancy gloves, though, wears MacHeath, dear  
So there's not a trace of red  
  
On the sidewalk, Sunday mornin'  
Lies a body oo-oozin' life  
Someones sneakin' 'round the cor-or-orner  
Is that someone Mack the Knife?  
  
From a tugboat, by the river  
A cement bags drooppin' down  
The cement, that's just for the weight, dear  
I'll bet you Mackys back in tow-own  
  
Mr Miller, disappeared, dear  
After drawin' out all of his cash  
Went tap city, and MacHeath spends like a sailor  
Did our boy do, somethin' rash?  
  
Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver  
Polly Peacham, Miss Lucy Brown  
Oh, the line forms on the right, dear  
Now that Mackys back in town

Although we're few in numbers, we're the finest in the land  
We play at wakes and weddings and at every fancy ball  
And when we play the funerals, we play the March from Saul  
  
Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away  
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play  
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand  
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band  
  
Right now we are rehearsing for a very swell affair  
The annual celebration, all the gentry will be there  
When General Grant to Ireland came he took me by the hand  
Says he, ""I never saw the likes of MacNamara's Band""

Oh, my name is Uncle Julius and from Sweden I did come  
To play with MacNamara's Band and beat the big bass drum  
And when I march along the street the ladies think I'm grand  
They shout, ""There's Uncle Julius playing with an Irish band!""  
  
Oh, I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a uniform of green  
And I'm the funniest lookin' Swede that you have ever seen  
There is O'Brians, O'Ryans, O'Sheehans and Meehans, they come from Ireland  
But, by yimminy, I'm the only Swede in MacNamara's Band

How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless  
Sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in they dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all  
The years are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep  
The angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
Oh, morning stars together  
Proclaim the Holy birth  
And praises sing  
To God the King  
And peace to men on Earth  
  
How silently, how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of his heaven  
No ear may hear his coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls  
Will receive him still  
The dear Christ enters in  
  
Oh, holy child of Bethlehem  
Descend to us we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in  
Be born in us today  
We hear the christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us  
Our Lord Emanuel

Sick of trying

Feared of dying

Moments before we two  
Drifted apart?

That spark may burn again

If love still can remember

Hang your nose and cry
