Violins are all around you  
I can hear the chords resound  
Of sounding brass  
That seems to say I've found  
I've found you, I've found you.  
  
Strange music in my ears  
Only now as you spoke, did it start.  
Strange music of the sphere  
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart?  
You appear and I hear song sublime  
Song that I'm incapable of.  
So Dear, let me hold you near  
While we treasure ev'ry measure,  
So that time can never change  
The strange, new music of love.

Sweet, Sweet Georgia Brown.  
And ever since she came, the common folks all claim, say  
  
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.  
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.  
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,  
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).  
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town.  
Since she came why it's a shame how she's cooled 'em down.  
Fellas that she can't get must be fellas that she ain't met.  
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, Sweet Georgia Brown.  
  
All you gals will get the blues,  
All you pals will surely lose.  
And, there's but one excuse.  
Now I've told you who she was,  
And I've told you what she does,  
Still, give this gal her dues.  
This pretty maiden's prayer is answered anywhere  
  
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.  
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.  
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,

Bing Crosby,Swinging on A Star,/b/bing+crosby/swinging+on+a+star_20528299.html,"Would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a mule  
  
A mule is an animal with long funny ears  
Kicks up at anything he hears  
His back is brawny but his brain is weak  
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak  
And by the way, if you hate to go to school  
You may grow up to be a mule  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a pig  
  
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face  
His shoes are a terrible disgrace  
He has no manners when he eats his food  
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude  
But if you don't care a feather or a fig  
You may grow up to be a pig  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a fish  
  
A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook  
He can't write his name or read a book  
To fool the people is his only thought  
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught  
But then if that sort of life is what you wish  
You may grow up to be a fish  
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish  
  
And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo  
Every day you meet quite a few  
So you see it's all up to you  
You can be better than you are  
You could be swingin' on a star

And memories that linger like a haunting tune

Than never to have loved at all

It's killing me  
  
What do they do with your soul  
Is it just lying there busted  
When did you lose all control  
Is there someone to be trusted  
With my mind  
  
Oh there's insufficient evidence  
Of what just might come after  
But sometimes out of nowhere  
There's demented sounds of laughter  
  
Are we all haunted by  
The ghost - imagination  
It just can't be  
I've seen them there  
Howling at the moon  
  
Is it just me  
Or does somebody else believe this  
Well I'm not alone  
And I'm not afraid  
There's just one way to see

Yes there's a chance of returning  
Turn to me  
  
The fundamental principles  
Say nothing of forever  
But those are voices that I hear  
Or I'm just not so clever

Black Sabbath,After Forever,/b/black+sabbath/after+forever_20019384.html,"Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?  
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave  
Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you?  
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school?  
  
When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?  
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's a
fool?  
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways  
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days  
  
Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say  
If they knew you believe in God above?  
They should realize before they criticize  
that God is the only way to love  
  
Is your mind so small that you have to fall  
In with the pack wherever they run  
Will you still sneer when death is near  
And say they may as well worship the sun?  
  
I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ  
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced  
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?  
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve  
  
Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone  
Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one  
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate  
Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes! I think it's too late.

Her happy memories, dancing through her mind  
  
In days of romance

She'd dance the night away  
  
And as the seasons turn the days to years  
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers  
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen

Reality's that way  
Colours in your mind  
Satisfy your time  
  
Oh you, you know you must be blind  
To do something like this  
To take the sleep that you don't know  
You're giving death a kiss, oh, little fool now  
  
Your mind is full of pleasure  
Your body's looking ill  
To you it's shallow leisure  
So drop the acid pill,  
  
Don't stop to think now  
  
You're having a good time baby  
But that won't last  
Your mind's all full of things  
You're living too fast  
  
Go out enjoy yourself  
Don't bottle it in  
You need someone to help you  
To stick the needle in, yeah  
  
Now you know the scene  
Your skin starts turning green  
Your eyes no longer seeing  
Life's reality  
  
Push the needle in,  
Face death's sickly grin  
Holes are in your skin,  
Caused by deadly pin  
  
Head starts spinning 'round  
You fall down to the ground  
Feel your body heave  
Death's hands starts to weave  
  
It's too late to turn  
You don't want to learn  
Price of life you cry  
Now you're gonna die!

I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie  
I'm getting closer to the end of the line  
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine  
  
I'm living in a room without any view  
I'm living free because the rent's never due  
The synonyms of all the things that I've said  
Are just the riddles that are built in my head  
  
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven  
Window in time, through it I fly  
  
I've seen the stars disappear in the sun  
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun  
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars  
I don't believe there's any future in cause  
  
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven  
Window in time, through it I fly  
Yeah  
  
I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast  
I've seen the western world go down in the east  
The food of love became the greed of our time  
But now I'm living on the profits of pride

Go to the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all,  
Your back's to the wall  
  
Then chase the sun, n it tears away and breaks you as you run, you run, you
run  
  
Behind the smile, there's danger n a promise to be told, you never get old  
Life's fantasy, to be locked away n still you think you're free, you're free,
we're free  
  
So live for today tomorrow never comes  
  
Die young die young  
Can't you see the writting in the air  
Die young gonna die young  
Someone stopped the faith  
  
Go to the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all  
Then chase the sun, n it tears away n it breaks you as you run you run you run  
  
Live for today tomorrow never comes  
  
Die young

I'm falling through the universe again  
Down among a dead mans vision  
Faded dreams and nuclear fissions span  
  
The strings of fear they are holding up the race  
The puppets falling to the ground  
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space  
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found  
  
On this sinking ship I travel  
Faster than the speed of life  
Not so super nova burns  
The black holes turn and fade from sight  
  
The strings of fear they hide within the human race  
The answers buried underground  
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space  
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found  
  
And very soon  
The boundless moon  
Will show us light  
And as we crash  
We'll pray and kiss  
And say goodnight  
Goodnight

And that's the way you're going to stay  
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel  
But someone else's finger's on the control panel

Don't you want to be brother - Zero the hero  
When you gonna be brother - Zero the hero  
Impossibility impissibolity mother really a hero

It's easy and breezy for you  
You play your life to a different sound  
No edge no edge you got no knife have you  
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere  
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there  
Where the heroes sit by the river  
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver  
  
You stand there captain we all look  
You really are mediocre  
You are the champion in the Acme form book  
But I think you're just a joker  
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity  
But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around  
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing  
It's easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing

She's a twentieth century girl  
With her hands on the wheel  
Trying not to be sick again  
Seeing what she can borrow  
London's so nice back in your seamless rhymes  
But we're lost on the West way  
So we hold each other tightly  
And we can wait until tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're trying not to be sick again  
And holding on for tomorrow  
  
She's a twentieth century girl  
Holding on for dear life  
And so we hold each other tightly  
And hold on for tomorrow  
  
(Jim stops and gets out of the car  
Goes to a house in Emperor's Gate  
Through the door and to his room, and then he puts the TV on  
Turns it off and makes some tea  
Says modern life is rubbish)  
I'm holding on for tomorrow  
  
(Then Susan comes into the room  
She's a naughty girl with a lovely smile  
Says, 'let's take a drive to Primrose Hill  
It's windy there, and the view's so nice.'  
London ice can freeze your toes, like anyone, I suppose)  
You're holding on for tomorrow

Everything was sinking  
Said snow would come on Sunday  
The old school was due and the traffic grew  
Upon the Westway  
Where I stood watching comets lonesome trails  
Shining up above me the jet fuel it fell  
Down to earth where the money always comes first  
And the sirens sing  
  
Bring us the day they switch off the machines  
'Cause men in yellow jackets putting adverts inside my dreams  
An automated song and the whole world gone  
Fallen under the spell of the distance between us when we communicate  
Still picking up shortwave  
Somewhere they're out in space  
It depends how you're wired when the night's on fire  
Under the Westway  
  
Now it's magic arrows hitting the bull  
Doing one eighty still standing at last call  
When the flags coming down  
And the Last Post sounds  
Just like a love song  
For the way I feel about you  
Paradise not lost it's in you  
On a permanent basis I apologize  
But I am going to sing  
  
Hallelujah  
Sing it out loud and sing it to you  
Am I lost out at sea  
'Til a tide wash me up off the Westway

I cried she was deaf.  
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,  
Then said, ""What else you got left?""  
It was then that I got up to leave  
But she said, ""Don't forget,  
Everybody must give something back  
For something they get.""  
  
I stood there and hummed,  
I tapped on her drum  
And asked her how come.  
And she buttoned her boot,  
And straightened her suit,  
Then she said, ""Don't get cute.""  
So I forced my hands in my pockets  
And felt with my thumbs,  
And gallantly handed her  
My very last piece of gum.  
  
She threw me outside,  
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.  
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt,  
I went back and knocked.  
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,  
And I tried to make sense  
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  
That leaned up against--  
  
Her Jamaican rum  
And when she did come, I asked her for some.  
She said, ""No, dear.""  
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,  
You'd better spit out your gum.""  
She screamed till her face got so red,  
Then she fell on the floor,  
And I covered her up and then  
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.  
  
And when I was through  
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.  
And you, you took me in,  
You loved me then, you never wasted time.  
And I, I never took much,  
I never asked for your crutch  
And I don't ask for mine.

Bob Dylan,Ballad Of Donald White,/b/bob+dylan/ballad+of+donald+white_20155910.html,"My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

The fair fields all alone  
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron

And I thought of a goddess to beauty  
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle.  
  
I humbled myself to her beauty  
""Fair maiden, where do you belong ?  
Are you from heaven descended  
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne ?"".  
  
""Young man, I will tell you a secret  
It's true I'm a maid that is poor  
And to part from my vows and my promise  
Is more than my heart can endure.  
  
Therefore I remain at my service  
And go through all my hardship and toil  
And wait for the lad that has left me  
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"".

And hope to give you a surprise.

And you've been in my heart all the while

I felt an angel's kiss

In mortal bliss

I'll build my world around you

The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared

Seem to be all that there is

Like Blind Willie Mctell

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's Dream,/b/bob+dylan/bob+dylans+dream_20021589.html,"While riding on a train goin' west,  
I fell asleep for to take my rest.  
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,  
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.  
  
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room  
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,  
Where we together weathered many a storm,  
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.  
  
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,  
Our words were told, our songs were sung,  
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied  
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.  
  
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,  
We never thought we could ever get old.  
We thought we could sit forever in fun  
But our chances really was a million to one.  
  
As easy it was to tell black from white,  
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.  
And our choices were few and the thought never hit  
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.  
  
How many a year has passed and gone,  
And many a gamble has been lost and won,  
And many a road taken by many a friend,  
And each one I've never seen again.  
  
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
That we could sit simply in that room again.  
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,  
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag,/b/bob+dylan/bob+dylans+new+orleans+rag_20151228.html,"By Bob Dylan  
  
I was sittin' on a stump  
Down in New Orleans,  
I was feelin' kinda low down,  
Dirty and mean.  
Along came a fella  
And he didn't even ask.  
He says, ""I know of a woman  
That can fix you up fast. ""  
I didn't think twice,  
I said like I should,  
""Let's go find this lady  
That can do me some good. ""  
We walked across the river  
On a sailin' spree  
And we came to a door  
Called one-oh-three.  
  
I was just about ready  
To give it a little knock  
When out comes a fella  
Who couldn't even walk.  
He's linkin' and a-slinkin',  
Couldn't stand on his feet,  
And he moaned and he groaned  
And he shuffled down the street.  
Well, out of the door  
There comes another man.  
He wiggled and he wobbled,  
He couldn't hardly stand.  
He had this frightened  
Look in his eyes,  
Like he just fought a bear,  
He was ready to die.  
  
Well, I peeked through the key crack,  
Comin' down the hall  
Was a long-legged man  
Who couldn't hardly crawl.  
He muttered and he uttered  
In broken French,  
And he looked like he'd been through  
A monkey wrench.  
  
Well, by this time  
I was a-scared to knock,  
I was a-scared to move,  
I's in a state of shock.  
I hummed a little tune  
And I shuffled my feet  
And I started walkin' backwards  
Down that broad street.  
Well, I got to the corner,  
I tried my best to smile.  
I turned around the corner  
And I ran a bloody mile.  
Man, I wasn't runnin'  
'Cause I was sick,  
I was just a-runnin'  
To get out of there quick.  
  
Well, I tripped right along  
And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest.  
I musta run a mile  
In a minute or less.  
I walked on a log  
And I tripped on a stump,  
I caught a fast freight  
With a one-arm jump.  
So, if you're travelin' down  
Louisiana way,  
And you feel kinda lonesome  
And you need a place to stay,  
Man, you're better off  
In your misery  
Than to tackle that lady  
At one-oh-three.

Of looking your way, unless it's to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his business-like anger and bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you

Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.

Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you

Bob Dylan,Chimes Of Freedom,/b/bob+dylan/chimes+of+freedom_20021149.html,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing  
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight  
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain  
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning  
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened  
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail  
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder  
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze  
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder  
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind  
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind  
An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales  
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position  
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts  
All down in taken-for-granted situations  
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute  
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute  
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed  
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones  
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look  
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended  
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed  
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse  
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Dependin' on the way you feel that you live.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please heed these words that I speak.  
I know you've suffered much,  
But in this you are not so unique.  
All of us, at times, we might work too hard  
To have it too fast and too much,  
And anyone can fill his life up  
With things he can see but he just cannot touch.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please don't dismiss my case.  
I'm not about to argue,  
I'm not about to move to no other place.  
Now, each of us has his own special gift  
And you know this was meant to be true,  
And if you don't underestimate me,  
I won't underestimate you.

If I can't find my baby I'm gonna run away and hide  
Well, I been pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back  
pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back  
Well, I been praying for salvation  
Laying round in a one-room country shack  
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed  
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed  
'Til there's nothing left to see  
'Til the chains have been shattered and I been freed  
But I'm looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above  
looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above  
Rolling through the rain and hail  
Looking for the sunny side of love  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same  
I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my name

Bob Dylan,Disease Of Conceit,/b/bob+dylan/disease+of+conceit_20021470.html,"There's a whole lot of people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right down the highway straight down the line  
Rips into your senses through your body and your mind  
Nothing about it that's sweet  
The disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Steps into your eats into your soul  
Over your senses you have no control  
Ain't nothing too discreet about the disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of people dying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right out of nowhere and you're down for the count  
From the outside world the pressure will mount  
Turn you into a piece of meat  
The disease of conceit.  
  
Conceit is the disease that the doctors got no cure  
They've done a lot of research on it but what it is they're still not sure.  
  
There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people seeing trouble tonight fro the disease of conceit  
Give you delusions of grandeur an evil eye  
Give you the idea that you're too good to die  
The they bury you from head to feet  
From the disease of conceit.

Bob Dylan,Do You Hear What I Hear?,/b/bob+dylan/do+you+hear+what+i+hear_20855080.html,"Said the night wind to the little lamb  
Do you see what I see?  
Way up in the sky, little lamb  
Do you see what I see?  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite  
With a tail as big as a kite  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
A song, a song high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king  
Do you know what I know?  
In your palace warm, mighty king  
Do you know what I know?  
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
  
Said the king to the people everywhere  
Listen to what I say!  
Pray for peace, people, everywhere  
Listen to what I say!  
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light

Bob Dylan,Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight,/b/bob+dylan/dont+fall+apart+on+me+tonight_20021393.html,"Just a minute before you leave, girl  
Just a minute before you touch the door  
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?  
Do you think we can talk about it some more?  
You know the streets are filled with vipers  
Who've lost all ray of hope  
You know, it ain't even safe no more  
In the palace of the Pope.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Come over here from over there, girl  
Sit down here, you can have my chair  
I can't see us going anywhere, girl  
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there  
I wish I'd have been a doctor  
Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost  
Maybe I'd have done some good in the world  
'Stead of burning every bridge I crossed.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
I ain't too good at conversation, girl  
So you might not know exactly how I feel  
But if I could, I'd bring you to the mountaintop, girl  
And build you a house made out of stainless steel  
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting  
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches  
But I know that I can't move.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's gone but the past lives on  
Tomorrow's just one step beyond  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Who are these people who are walking towards you  
Do you know them or will there be a fight?  
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through  
Can they tell you what's wrong from right?  
  
Do you remember St. James Street  
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?  
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet  
And laid his life on the line.  
  
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl  
No more booby traps and bombs  
No more decadence and charm  
No more affection that's been misplaced, girl  
No more mud cake creatures lying in your arms  
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?  
He looked so baffled and bewildered  
When he played and we didn't dance.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.

It don't matter, anyhow  
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
If you don't know by now  
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and I'll be gone  
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on  
Don't think twice, it's all right  
  
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe

An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe

Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talkin' anyway  
So don't think twice, it's all right  
  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
Like you never did before  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
I can't hear you any more  
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told  
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul  
But don't think twice, it's all right  
  
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound, I can't tell  
But goodbye's too good a word, gal  
So I'll just say fare thee well  
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind  
You could have done better but I don't mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
But don't think twice, it's all right

Bob Dylan,Drifter's Escape,/b/bob+dylan/drifters+escape_20021406.html,"""Oh, help me in my weakness,""  
I heard the drifter say,  
As they carried him from the courtroom  
And were taking him away.  
""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one  
And my time it isn't long,  
And I still do not know  
What it was that I've done wrong.""  
  
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,  
A tear came to his eye,  
""You fail to understand,"" he said,  
""Why must you even try?""  
Outside, the crowd was stirring,  
You could hear it from the door.  
Inside, the judge was stepping down,  
While the jury cried for more.  
  
""Oh, stop that cursed jury,""  
Cried the attendant and the nurse,  
""The trial was bad enough,  
But this is ten times worse.""  
Just then a bolt of lightning  
Struck the courthouse out of shape,  
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray  
The drifter did escape.

Bob Dylan,Dusty Old Fairgrounds,/b/bob+dylan/dusty+old+fairgrounds_20190845.html,"by Bob Dylan  
  
Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring,  
The trucks and the trailers will be winding  
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route.  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun  
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling  
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen  
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling  
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,  
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.  
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend,  
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.  
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,  
Get that canvas flag a-flying.  
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging  
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,  
Hear that old music box a-banging.  
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as we're rolling,  
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.
