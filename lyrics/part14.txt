Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one  
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind the closed door  
But I will always be emotionally yours.  
  
Come baby, rock me, come baby, locl me into the shadows of your heart  
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start  
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for  
And I will always be emotionally yours.  
  
It's like my whole life never happened  
When I see you, it's if I never had a thought  
I know this dream, it might be crazy  
But it's the only one I got. Okay.  
  
Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied  
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide  
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores  
But I will always be emotionally yours.

Bob Dylan,Floater,/b/bob+dylan/floater_10043295.html,"Down over the window  
From the dazzling sunlit rays  
Through the back alleys, through the blinds  
Another one of them endless days  
  
Honey bees are buzzing  
Leaves begin to stir  
I'm in love with my second cousin  
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her  
  
I keep listening for footsteps  
But I ain't never hearing any  
From the boat, I fish for bullheads  
I catch a lot, sometimes too many  
  
A summer breeze is blowin'  
A squall is setting in  
Sometimes it's just plain stupid  
To get into any kind of wind  
  
Well the old men 'round here  
Sometimes they get on bad terms  
With the younger men,  
Old, young, age don't carry weight  
It doesn't matter in the end  
  
One of the boss' hangers-on  
Sometimes comes to call  
At times you least expect  
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,  
Inspire you with fear  
It has the opposite effect  
  
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town  
The old one is long gone  
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across  
Burns with the bark still on  
  
They say times are hard  
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose  
It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere  
We'll just have to see how it goes  
  
My old man, he's like some feudal lord  
He's got more lives than a cat  
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once  
Things come alive or they fall flat  
  
You can smell the pine wood burnin'  
You can hear the school bell ring  
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can  
If you wanna learn anything  
  
Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion  
It don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch  
Juliet said back to Romeo,  
Why don't you just shove off,  
If it bothers you so much  
  
They got outta here any way they could  
Cold rain can give you the shivers  
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,  
All the rest of them rebel rivers  
  
If you ever try to interfere with me  
Or cross my path again,  
You do so at the peril of your life  
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound  
I've seen enough heartache and strife  
  
My grandfather was a duck trapper,  
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes [?]  
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,  
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.  
  
I had 'em once, though I suppose  
To go along with all the ring dancing,  
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves  
I left all my dreams and hopes  
Buried under tobacco leaves  
  
Not always easy kicking someone up  
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task  
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up  
And tears or not, it's too much to ask.

Bob Dylan,Freight Train Blues,/b/bob+dylan/freight+train+blues_20021204.html,"I was born in Dixie in a boomer shack  
Just a little shanty by the railroad track  
Freight train was it taught me how to cry  
Hummin' of the driver was my lullaby  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes  
And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know  
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.  
  
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my old ma here,  
She was the only daughter of the engineer  
My sweetheart loved a brakeman and it ain't no joke  
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes  
And when the whistle blows I gotta go oh mama, don't you know  
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.  
  
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again  
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train  
Every place I want to go  
I never can go, because you know  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes.

Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
For she once was a true love of mine  
If you go when the snowflakes storm  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends  
Please see she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howlin' winds  
Please see if her hair hangs long  
If it rolls and flows all down her breast  
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long  
For that's the way I remember her best  
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all  
Many times I've often prayed  
In the darkness of my night  
In the brightness of my day  
So if you're travelin' the North Country fair

I see the sailin' boats across the bay go by.  
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street  
And then I turn my head, for you're approachin' me.  
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room  
With a golden loom.  
  
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine  
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.  
I see the hungry clouds up above your face  
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.  
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom  
With your golden loom.  
  
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light  
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.  
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail  
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.  
But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume  
And your golden loom.

Bob Rivers,On A Horse With Hussein,/b/bob+rivers/on+a+horse+with+hussein_20739981.html,"(Horse With No Name - America)  
  
In the aftermath of the jihad  
We were looking for lowlife scum  
There were bombs and guns  
In caves and things  
But Osama must have sprouted some wings  
  
The next thing we saw was a videotape  
And the proof  
It left no doubt  
The heat was hot  
But the trails been cold  
And Bin-Laden has not been fun  
  
He could be ridin' through the desert  
On a horse with Hussein  
It felt good to get out of the caves  
In the desert you can make up a fake name  
And there ain't no bombs  
For to give you no pain  
  
With his beard shaved  
In the desert sun  
Osama begins to turn to red  
In the sun's rays  
You know It ain't no fun  
He's gonna need a another towel for his head  
Some Groucho Marx glasses  
And a nose that sticks out  
Is the perfect disguise  
It's been said  
Avoid the city life  
And don't make a sound  
Or the Marines will fill you with lead  
  
He could be ridin' through the desert  
On a horse with Hussein  
It felt good to get out of the caves  
In the desert you can make up a fake name  
And there ain't no bombs  
For to give you no pain

That Prince Charles and Lady Di were through.  
Was waiting in line at the grocery store.  
Took a peek at the dirt about Demi Moore.  
And it took me by surprise I must say  
When I found out the Pope was gay.  
I read it in the tabloids.  
Elvis Presley's doing just fine.  
They put it in the tabloids.  
Got a look at Fergi's boobs, my my.  
Honey, honey, yeah.  
You know JFK didn't really die.  
They got a picture and he looks all right.  
And Ross Perot's hanging out with ET.  
This woman had a kid at a hundred and three.  
And you could have seen it all for yourself  
'Cause it's right there upon the shelf.  
Oh, I read it in the tabloids.  
You know Madonna used to be a boy.  
I saw it in the tabloids  
Right next to a cure for hemorrhoids.

Cause Santa Clause is coming soon In his big old rusty

What could be worse  
Than two nuns, three old ladies and a nurse?  
  
The restroom door said gentlemen

And when the black night falls upon you,  
You'll find it easy to be kind... Kind.  
The stars may shimmer in the black sky,  
The wind may rustle in the trees.  
You may be worried he may psych you,  
You might be praying on your knees.  
Ah, but when you realize he needs you  
And when you finally take some time,  
The cool black night will fall upon you,  
You'll find it easy to unwind.  
Hey, the moon may rise on the misty mountain,  
You'll wish you never made the climb.  
But when the black night's finally with you,  
You'll find it easy to be kind,  
You'll find it easy to unwind,  
You'll find it easy to be blind.

Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green

On the blue blood streets of boston  
Up in berkeley and out in queens

And he's walking the streets for nancy

There's a hard moon risin' on the streets tonight  
There's a reckless feeling in your heart as you head out tonight  
Through the concrete canyons to the midtown light  
Where the latest neon promises are burning bright  
  
Past the open windows on the darker streets  
Where unseen angry voices flash and children cry  
Past the phony posers with their worn out lines  
The tired new money dressed to the nines  
The low life dealers with their bad designs  
And the dilettantes with their open minds  
  
You're out on the town, safe in the crowd  
Ready to go for the ride  
Searching the eyes, looking for clues  
There's no way you can hide  
The fire inside  
  
Well you've been to the clubs and the discotheques  
Where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises  
Where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks  
Do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious  
And the lights go down and they dance real close  
And for one brief instant they pretend they're safe and warm  
  
Then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone  
The darkness scatters as the lights flash on  
They hold one another just a little too long  
And they move apart and then move on  
  
On to the street, on to the next  
Safe in the knowledge that they tried  
Faking the smile, hiding the pain  
Never satisfied  
The fire inside  
Fire inside  
  
Now the hour is late and he thinks you're asleep  
You listen to him dress and you listen to him leave  
Like you knew he would  
You hear his car pull away in the street  
Then you move to the door and you lock it when  
He's gone for good  
  
Then you walk to the window and stare at the moon  
Riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky  
And it comes to you how it all slips away  
Youth and beauty are gone one day  
No matter what you dream or feel or say  
It ends in dust and disarray  
  
Like wind on the plains, sand through the glass  
Waves rolling in with the tide  
Dreams die hard and we watch them erode  
But we cannot be denied

No melody can move me  
When I'm feelin blue  
I guess I'm coming through and soothe me  
Thanks for the joy that you've given me  
I want you to klnow I believe in your soul  
Let me rhyme in harmony  
You helped me along, you're makin me strong

Massive storms

Feel the wind  
And set yourself the bolder course  
Keep your heart  
As open as a shrine  
You'll sail the perfect line  
  
And after all  
The dead ends and the lessons learned  
After all  
The stars have turned to stone  
There'll be peace  
Across the great unbroken void  
All benign

You'll be fine

I',d never felt that strong  
Like a rock

Didn't have a care  
Working for peanuts  
Not a dime to spare  
But I was lean and  
Solid everywhere  
Like a rock  
  
My hands were steady  
My eyes were clear and bright  
My walk had purpose  
My steps were quick and light  
And I held firmly  
To what I felt was right  
Like a rock  
  
Like a rock, I was strong as I could be  
Like a rock, nothin', ever got to me  
Like a rock, I was something to see  
Like a rock  
  
And I stood arrow straight  
Unencumbered by the weight  
Of all these hustlers and their schemes  
I stood proud, I stood tall  
High above it all  
I still believed in my dreams  
  
Twenty years now  
Where',d they go?  
Twenty years  
I don',t know  
I sit and I wonder sometimes  
Where they',ve gone  
  
And sometimes late at night  
When I',m bathed in the firelight  
The moon comes callin', a ghostly white  
And I recall  
I recall  
  
Like a rock, standin', arrow straight  
Like a rock, chargin', from the gate  
Like a rock, carryin', the weight  
Like a rock

Like a rock, hard against the wind

Up and leaves you flat  
Don't you laugh my friend sometimes it happens just like that  
First you feel the anger then the sorrow will soon take control  
And there'll be hard times for sure  
Long cold lonely nights  
  
It might not sound like much  
But it'll mean a lot you'll see  
Every hour you survive will come to be  
A little victory  
Little victory  
  
As you struggle through each day  
Each strange new day  
Feelin' lost and wounded tryin' hard to find your way  
No one there to talk it out with  
Learnin' how to sleep alone  
Overcomin' each new doubt  
Tryin' hard just to accept it all  
  
Everytime you keep control when you're cut off at the knees  
Everytime you take a punch and still stand at ease  
Little victories  
Little victories  
  
And when night falls and there's no one around  
The cruelest time of all and not one sound  
Listenin' to the wind blow  
Listenin' to the tickin' of the clock  
Tryin' hard to forget  
Tryin' hard to just accept it all  
  
As you step out in the night take a lesson from the trees  
Watch the way they learn to bend with each breeze  
Little victories  
Everytime you make it through  
It's another little victory  
Day by day minute by minute  
Little victories

They've got themselves a brand new history  
From Revisionism Street

The arc of stardom's natural course  
The inevitable decline  
The wolves waiting at the door

Unaware they're workin' late tonight

Bob Seger,Simplicity,/b/bob+seger/simplicity_20593944.html,"Simplicity it works for me  
It keeps me runnin' hard, and sharp and true  
I focus on the basic stuff  
And pretty soon I'm comin up on you  
So much clutter clouds our way  
Fundamentals win the day  
I break you down size you up  
I see a path and then I bust a move  
Before you know we'll hit you babe  
I finish and I'm on to somethin' new  
Complex theories have their place  
I like throwdowns in your face  
Its clear, when it's really really near  
And its everything you need  
Rise and be worthy of the prize  
Get exactly what you need  
Simplicity in everything  
In every single thing you say and do  
Don't get lost, in foggy stuff  
Stay on track and let it come to you  
Keep your focus on your goal  
Use that iron hard control  
Use your power and your speed  
Get exactly what you need

The champagne is on ice

In your brand new dress  
Girl, you sure look nice  
  
Have a good time  
Honey, don't look back  
Stone in the middle of the aftermath  
  
Don't wink, don't blink  
Don't let 'em think  
His leavin's got you down  
Stand straight, hang tough  
When they bring it up  
Baby hold your ground  
  
If they pry, don't sigh  
Pass it off with a laugh  
It's all part of living through the aftermath  
  
You can do it honey  
Keep that smile so sunny  
You can show them what they want to see  
Yes, you can  
  
It's a cold, hard scene  
The singles thing  
Losers everywhere  
And it hurts to the bone  
Headin' home alone  
When someone used to be there  
  
So you take a few falls  
And you learn to bounce back  
It's all part of living through the aftermath  
  
Living through the aftermath  
Baby, don't look back  
It's the aftermath

Bob Seger,The Famous Final Scene,/b/bob+seger/famous+final+scene_20021982.html,"Words and music by bob seger  
  
Think in terms of bridges burned  
Think of seasons that must end  
See the rivers rise and fall  
They will rise and fall again  
Everything must have an end  
Like an ocean to a shore  
Like a river to a stream  
Like a river to a stream  
It's the famous final scene  
And how you tried to make it work  
Did you really think it could  
How you tried to make it last  
Did you really think it would  
Like a guest who stayed too long  
Now it's finally time to leave  
Yes, it's finally time to leave  
Take it calmly and serene  
It's the famous final scene  
It's been coming on so long  
You were just the last to know  
It's been a long time since you've smiled  
Seems like oh so long ago  
Now the stage has all been set  
And the nights are growing cold  
Soon the winter will be here  
And there's no one warm to hold  
Now the lines have all been read  
And you knew them all by heart  
Now you move toward the door  
Here it comes the hardest part  
Try the handle of the road  
Feeling different feeling strange  
This can never be arranged  
As the light fades from the screen  
From the famous final scene

Bob Seger,The Last Song,/b/bob+seger/the+last+song_20703671.html,"Don't you know it doesn't matter  
Who you are or what you'd really like to be  
Cause it's all without your mind  
And you weren't born blind  
  
And you don't have to see  
Just keep it in your heart  
And if it takes you far  
It's a start man  
It's a start  
Women were sent from heaven above  
And love needs to be loved  
Needs to be loved  
  
Love needs to be loved  
Love needs to be loved  
Love needs to be loved  
Love needs to be loved

Bob Seger,The Long Goodbye,/b/bob+seger/the+long+goodbye_20593941.html,"The silent fall of evening snow  
Another thing you can't control  
Does it chill or warm you soul tonight  
You've become a mystery  
Will I earn your honesty  
I'll never know if we agree  
If you're not here  
And we travel separate roads  
And we carry different loads  
And in the end we stay or go  
The long goodbye continues on  
Through fog and rain and far beyond  
You stay awhile and then you're gone again  
I look into your restless eyes  
You turn away it's no surprise  
I wonder if it's even wise but I'm still here

Bob Seger,The Ring,/b/bob+seger/the+ring_20021953.html,"By the light of the moon  
To a 50's tune  
He pledged his love to her  
A girl so rare  
A girl so fair  
The girl for him for sure  
He could see himself getting up every mornin'  
For the rest of his life  
Just to look in those eyes so blue  
It was all he ever wanted to do  
She was all he'd ever need to see him through  
  
They were still in their teens  
When he gave her the ring  
They were married late one May  
And they moved into a little house  
On the far end of town  
Out by the big highway  
And all through the days  
And all through the nights  
The cars and trucks rolled on by  
And he slept through it all just fine  
Every night he slept just fine  
  
Sometimes she'd stare at the stars out the window  
Sometimes she'd walk 'neath the moon  
Sometimes she'd sit there just watching him sleeping  
Hoping the dawn would come soon  
  
She'd done well in school  
She'd followed the rules  
And she'd always stood out from the rest  
She'd go off to college  
And work her way through  
Then move to some city out west  
She had it all planned  
She'd have her career  
She'd have all of the things that she'd always lacked  
  
She'd wake up one morning all packed  
And leave here and never look back  
  
Most of her friends thought it soon would be over  
Not many thought it would last  
Most seemed to think they were all wrong for each other  
And soon it would pass - soon it would pass  
  
Now twenty years have gone  
And her kids have moved on  
And she's still on the far end of town  
Her youngest - she's livin' somewhere in L. A.  
And her oldest - he works on a nearby farm  
Her husband comes home  
And they talk over supper  
He's usually the first to turn in  
Another day comes to an end  
Another day just ends  
  
And sometimes in the wee hours when the traffic dies down  
She'll hear the sound of some bird on the wing  
And she'll look out the window and she'll look at his picture  
But not at the ring - not at the ring  
She never looks at the ring

East of Omaha  
You can listen to the engine  
Moanin' out his one note song  
You can think about the woman

But your thoughts will soon be wandering  
The way they always do  
When you're ridin' sixteen hours  
And there's nothin' much to do  
And you don't feel much like ridin',  
You just wish the trip was through

Strung out from the road  
And you feel the eyes upon you  
As you're shakin' off the cold  
You pretend it doesn't bother you  
But you just want to explode  
  
Most times you can't hear 'em talk,  
Other times you can  
All the same old cliches,  
""Is that a woman or a man?""  
And you always seem outnumbered,  
You don't dare make a stand  
  
Here I am  
On the road again  
There I am  
Up on the stage  
Here I go  
Playin' star again  
There I go  
Turn the page  
  
Out there in the spotlight  
You're a million miles away  
Every ounce of energy  
You try to give away  
As the sweat pours out your body  
Like the music that you play  
  
Later in the evening  
As you lie awake in bed  
With the echoes from the amplifiers  
Ringin' in your head  
You smoke the day's last cigarette,  
Rememberin' what she said  
  
Here I am  
On the road again  
There I am  
Up on the stage  
Here I go  
Playin' star again  
There I go

She's got something I want man, it's something I need  
It takes more than the night to satisfy me  
I stand accused  
That I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby, I can always run  
  
To a heart of chrome  
And a soul of steel  
We've done more white lines than you'll know any one we could steal  
And when I give her the gun  
You know she feels so right  
And we don't let go when we're alone when I'm holding her so tight.  
  
She's got something I want man, it's something I need  
It takes more than the night to satisfy me.  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby, I can always run  
  
And when the morning comes and I go to sleep  
When I close my eyes she's waiting for me  
I know that tonight she'll satisfy me.  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby, I can always run

Bon Jovi,Another Reason To Believe,/b/bon+jovi/another+reason+to+believe_20525224.html,"Love lives in New York City  
He got a place off of the park  
Heard he was standing in the ruins  
And in his hands a broken heart  
He called an army of his angels  
I heard they had to hide their wings  
It was them who brought you water  
If you listen closely I know you can hear  
The choir singing  
  
Chorus  
Hey, hallelujah, baby  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you, baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere you'll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
I saw him down south of Canal Street  
Right there in a mother's eyes  
At a table in a restaurant window  
In a taxi passing by  
Love went running up the stairwell  
When the sky came falling down  
It was him in a newborn baby's cry  
He was there to make that sound  
That keeps this whole world spinning 'round  
  
Chorus  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you, baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere you'll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
It's different than it was before  
Now we need it even more  
Fire's falling from the sky  
Innocence just said goodbye  
It may never be the same  
Maybe it was time to change  
A time to grieve  
A time to cry  
A time to live  
A time to fly

Growing up today  
Theres many mountains you must climb  
Youre not the only one  
Cause everybodys on that line  
Hey mister know it all  
What do you recommend  
You think you know the answers  
But the questions never end  
  
Young hearts better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
So look in your mirror  
You got nothing to lose  
Don't waste your time away  
Thinkin bout yesterdays blues  
  
Born outta passion  
To a world gone cold  
Ya wear it on your shoulders  
Its a heavy, heavy load I know  
Love and its emotions  
Come knocking at your door  
Young hearts will be broken  
And times the only cure  
  
Young hearts better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
So look in your mirror  
You got nothing to lose  
Don't waste your time away  
Thinkin bout yesterdays blues  
  
Temptation makes us fall from grace  
But the angels were sinners  
And the sinners saints  
Forgive yourself cause were all the same  
Everybody rides on the karma train  
  
Young hearts  
Better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
Look in your mirror  
Itll tell you the truth  
Don't waste your time away  
Don't waste your life away, no, no  
Live today  
Theres no time to lose  
Cause when tomorrow comes  
Its all just yesterdays news  
  
All just yesterday news

Bon Jovi,Bang A Drum,/b/bon+jovi/bang+a+drum_20022186.html,"I went to see the preacher  
To teach me how to pray  
He looked at me and smiled  
Then the preacher turned away  
He said if you want to tell him something  
You ain't gotta fold your hands  
Say it with your heart  
Your soul and believe it  
And I'd say amen  
  
Bang a drum for the sinners  
Bang a drum for the sins  
Bang a drum for the losers  
And those who win  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
Bang a drum for yourself son  
And a drum for me  
  
I called upon my brother just the  
Other day, he said: John I'm gonna  
Die if I don't start to live again  
I work each day and night like clockwork  
Just trying to make ends meet  
I could kick this bad world's ass  
If I could just get on my feet  
  
I'd bang a drum for the dying  
Bang a drum for the truth  
Bang a drum for the innocence  
Lost in our youth  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
Bang a drum for you brother  
And a drum for me  
  
I don't know where all the rivers run  
I don't know how far, I don't know how come  
But I'm gonna die believin'  
Each step that I take  
Ain't worth the ground that  
I walk on  
If we don't walk it our  
Own way  
  
No I don't claim to be a wise man  
A poet or a saint  
I'm just another man who's searching  
For a better way  
But my heart beats loud as thunder  
For the things that I believe  
Sometimes I wanna run for cover  
Sometimes I want to scream  
  
Bang a drum for tomorrow  
Bang a drum for the past  
Bang a drum for the heroes  
That won't come back  
Bang a drum for the promise  
Bang a drum for the lies  
Bang a drum for the lovers  
And the tears they've cried  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
But as long as my heart keeps on bangin'  
I got a reason to believe

Bon Jovi,Bed Of Roses,/b/bon+jovi/bed+of+roses_20022208.html,"Sitting here wasted and wounded  
At this old piano  
Trying hard to capture  
The moment this morning I don't know  
'Cause a bottle of vodka  
Is still lodged in my head  
And some blond gave me nightmares  
I think she is still in my bed  
As I dream about movies  
They won't make of me when I'm dead  
  
With an ironclad fist I wake up and  
French kiss the morning  
While some marching band keeps  
Its own beat in my head  
While we're talking  
About all of the things that I long to believe  
About love and the truth and  
What you mean to me  
And the truth is baby you're all that I need  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses  
  
Well I'm so far away  
That each step that I take is on my way home  
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night  
Just to see through this payphone  
Still I run out of time  
Or it's hard to get through  
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you  
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,  
Baby blind love is true  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses  
  
The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry  
The barkeeper's wig's crooked  
And she's giving me the eye  
I might have said yeah  
But I laughed so hard I think I died  
  
When you close your eyes  
Know I'll be thinking about you  
While my mistress she calls me  
To stand in her spotlight again  
Tonight I won't be alone  
But you know that don't  
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove  
For it's you that I'd die to defend  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses

I didn't have much money so I stole you a rose  
You were dressed like an orphan in salvation army clothes  
  
I never thought I'd lose you,nor I'd rather go blind  
I thought I saw a future but the fortune teller lied  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
I know I wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes  
When I was choking on the words to say you your fingers down my throat  
The first night I said I love you you told me to go to hell  
You were giving me head on that creaky bed at the old duval motel  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
No one even cried we were one of a kind  
  
Love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine

You take back the holy water now all that's left is bitter wine
