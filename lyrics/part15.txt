They tell me you want me but I hear they've got you  
They made you a lawman with a badge made of silver  
They paid you some money to sell them my blood  
  
But you say this ain't about me, this ain't about you  
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through  
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed  
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away  
  
I wonder what would have happened  
If you were the killer  
And I was the hero  
Would things be the same  
Or would I have traded  
Your life for my own life  
Would I have paid  
Your debts in your place  
  
But this ain't about me, this ain't about you  
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through  
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed  
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away  
  
Blood money  
That's what I call it  
'Cause money for blood ain't no fair exchange  
Blood money  
Bought and then sold you  
But your conscience is all you can take to your grave

Our time, our way  
  
So hold me close better hang on tight  
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride  
We're two kids hitching down the road of life  
Our world, our fight  
  
If we stand side by side (all night)  
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright)

And roller skates in bed  
  
Crash rides the greyhound from his hometown  
When he comes around 'cause they don't let him drive now  
Mixed up as a milkshake  
But make no mistake  
They're shooting for the stars

We're invincible together  
We can be so tragical, whatever  
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar

Share a toothpick, trading lipstick  
Watching traffic for days at the diner  
Holding hands, making big plans  
Playing Superman, he was wearing eyeliner  
Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm

Getting high on lust and cigarettes  
Living life with no regrets  
At least they're gonna try to fly

In the middle of the night  
Seems like a lifetime  
When youre wondering whos wrong or right  
One confession would resurrect the truth  
Revenge or forgiveness for sins between me and you  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street, lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell, I pray the rain disappears  
I'm headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire  
  
You never find a reason why love falls from grace  
Some kind of voodoo, like a spirit you can't embrace  
Theres a voice in the mirror, and a ghost in my heart  
That relives the passion before we were torn apart  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street, lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell, I pray the rain disappears  
I'm headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire

Theres a danger of getting so close to you  
There comes a time  
When the walls fade away  
And when love turns to bitter blue  
Sometimes it feels like its so hard to stay  
Last night we went to bed angry  
We didint mean what we said  
Seems we never get past forgiveness  
We try to hide, we never learn  
To swallow our pride.  
On the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hate  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
When youre misunderstood  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
Baby life has no guarantee  
Never knowing where loves gonna lead  
Even through youre a part of me  
We have to deal with our pain separately  
Sometimes we both feel like victims  
With no easy way out not, no, no  
Somehow we stand by each other  
When were desperate, and drowning in  
The shadows of doubt.  
On the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hate  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
The times we share the tenderness  
Are the times that keep us alive  
You get in my face, you rough me up  
But baby you know  
can't hurt me nough, to give you up  
And make me let go  
Make me let got oh no, no.  
When youre on the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hare  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
When youre misunderstood  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
Downside of love  
Loves just a long, long road baby  
Yes theres a down side of love  
Stand by my side baby  
When youre on the downside of love  
No, no, no  
Downside of love  
cause its a long, long road baby  
Downside of love.

That cheap bass and guitar and our wildest dreams  
We were searching for a savior like anybody else  
Trying to save ourselves from ourselves

We acted like our heroes they just didn't understand  
And we were never afraid to fall  
It was us and those four walls  
  
Just a garage band, we weren't alive  
We were livin' in Garageland  
Nothing ever felt so right  
Just us, those guitars and a Saturday night  
  
'Cause with a strap on your back, you have wings on your feet  
You felt like a king when you walked down the street  
We heard those old records and knew we belonged  
When the drums hit the groove, we'd all sing along

Cause I like it real slow  
  
All the way back home  
On the homebound train  
I'm going down, down, down, down, down  
On the homebound train  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm heading home  
To be with my baby  
Where I belong  
Coming down the tracks now  
See, I done my time  
I'm going back now  
To that home of mine  
Well, here I come baby  
  
Here I come baby  
Here I come baby  
  
All the way back home  
On that homebound train  
I'm going down, down, down, down, down  
On that homebound train

Bon Jovi,I Am,/b/bon+jovi/i+am_20426823.html,"How you spend your minutes are what matters  
All tomorrows come from yesterdays  
When you're feeling broken, bruised and sometimes shattered  
Blow out the candles on the cake  
Like everything's a big mistake  
  
It seems you always wait for life to happen  
And your last buck can't buy a lucky break  
If all we've got is us then life's worth living  
And if you're in, you know I'm in  
I'm ready and I'm willing  
  
I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
  
We're just who we are, there's no pretending  
It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin  
Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending  
And if you're in you know I'm in  
I'm ready and I'm willing  
  
Chorus: I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
  
I ain't got no halo hanging over my head  
I ain't gonna judge you, I'm just here to love you  
I am, I am

You can read my life like a fortune told  
I've seen the dream, there's no land of Oz  
But I got my brain and I got a heart  
And courage built I won't let go  
What we need right now is, soul  
  
I can't do this, you can't do that  
They feed us lines but I won't act  
And all good things will come to pass  
But the truth is all you have to have  
And would you lie for it?  
(Do you) cry for it?  
(Would you) die for it?  
Would you

With every breath that I breathe  
You and me can turn a whisper to a scream  
I believe, I believe  
  
You know what you came here for  
You'll pay the cost,  
like it's your cross to bear  
Are we the ones that put it there  
Would you scheme for it  
scream for it, bleed for it  
Would you  
  
I believe, I believe  
Believe we're still worth  
The fight you'll see  
There's no hope for this world tonight  
I believe, I believe  
  
Don't look up on your movie screens  
In record stores or magazines  
Close your eyes and you will see  
That you are all you really need

With every breath that I breathe  
You and me can turn a  
whisper to a scream

Just want to know that I'm alive  
Don't want to live forever

Gonna live while I'm alive

You can see the glass half-full

Around this neighborhood  
My brother's girlfriend's pregnant  
And today she's moving in  
My friends all play the lottery  
And swear one day they'll win

When that day comes that we walk down the aisle  
She'll make me feel like a prince, a lord or a king  
She likes to wear her stripe with her plaids

Somebody is gonna take her (you see)

It's warm as a fire is bright  
  
Soon there'll be toys for the good girls and boys  
And reindeer are heading our way  
Yes, and Santa will come down the chimney above  
There's one thing I wanted to say  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do  
  
I saw a child sit with old Mr. Claus  
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was  
Now the old man grew cautious on how he would say  
That is the greatest gift, one you can give everyday  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do  
  
Now the mistle-toe and the house a-glow  
All the world seems at ease tonight  
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass  
Is why can't every day be so bright?  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas

If that's what it takes

I bet you swore you'd never let love back inside  
'Cause it hurt you way too bad to say good-bye  
Now, there'll be times when I might put us to the test  
And it's hard for broken hearts to just forget  
But I'm driving blind, I'll lay it all on the line for you

You know your favorite old pair of shoes  
The ones with the hole in the toe you wont lose  
Your favorite record that's all scratched and used  
But still you love to play when your feeling blue  
  
That faded rose that's all dried out  
Those bukowski poems we couldn't live without  
Your high school pic when you had wild hair  
That stormy day on the beach that got us here  
  
Oh, you better believe theres just one thing you need  
Can't you see...  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams  
Its just me baby  
  
Just like a shadow 10 feet tall  
Standing right behind you should you fall  
Ill be the one to hold you up to walk  
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl  
  
Abd if your waves should ever break at sea  
Ill be there waiting, I'm that sandy beach  
I'm that same old dog, scratching those same fleas  
Ill be by your side, you can count on me  
  
Its just me baby  
Its just me baby  
If theres just one thing that you should keep  
In your book of dreams

Whats it gonna take til you believe in me

Looking shiny new, feeling really strong  
You can tell him that Ill tell him  
He can just move on

Bon Jovi,Just Older,/b/bon+jovi/just+older_20022176.html,"Hey, man, it's been a while  
Do you remember me?  
When I hit the streets I was 17  
A little wild, a little green  
  
I've been up and down and in between  
After all these years  
Can you believe I'm still chasing that dream  
But I ain't looking over my shoulder  
  
[Chorus]  
I like the bed I'm sleeping in  
It's just like me, it's broken in  
It's not old -- just older  
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans  
This skin I'm in it's alright with me  
It's not old -- just older  
  
It's good to see your face  
You ain't no worse for wear  
Breathing that California air  
When we took on the world  
When we were young and brave  
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave  
And we're standing here shoulder to shoulder  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not old enough to sing the blues  
But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes  
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff  
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose  
  
Well, I look in the mirror  
I don't hate what I see  
There's a few more lines staring back at me  
The nights have grown a little colder  
Hey man, I gotta run  
Now you take care  
  
If you see coach T. Tell him I cut my hair  
It's been all these years  
Can you believe I'm still chasing dreams  
But I ain't looking over my shoulder

Bon Jovi,Justice In The Barrel,/b/bon+jovi/justice+in+the+barrel_20022192.html,"Hey mister can you help me  
I'm a loner on the run  
I'm just looking for tomorrow  
And I ain't gonna hurt no one  
  
I jumped headfirst into a bottle  
I was looking for a friend  
Came up just short of nothing  
I didn't find the truth I only found an end  
  
So tell me who's gonna save me  
Or my father or my son  
When the only justice a man can see  
Is the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
I been broke and I've been hungry  
I think they're both my middle name  
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough  
Still guess I can't complain  
  
'Cause what you get in life you take it  
You've gotta hold on and make it last  
They say good things come to those who wait  
But it's life that goes so fast  
  
And when there's just one rule you live by  
Each day you kiss the rising sun  
When you live and die by the life we breathe  
In the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
Guns talk to me in my sleep at night  
And a gun somewhere is burning  
With my name  
  
Winners are losers  
And losers will have to face  
All those yesterdays  
And all of the dreams they blew away  
  
So mister can you help me  
Or are you my gun  
Have the ghosts of justice  
Brought you here to me to taste  
The barrel of a loaded gun  
  
There's justice in the barrel  
Of a loaded gun

Bon Jovi,Kidnap An Angel,/b/bon+jovi/kidnap+an+angel_20806349.html,"I get up every morning, drink coffee alone  
My house it's too quiet, I'm the only one home  
I let the newspapers pile up at the door  
I can't be bothered, I don't read 'em no more  
The flowers are blooming, that you planted last spring  
I can't make much sense out of anything  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
  
I get in the car like I do every day  
Wondering how in the world did it turn out this way?  
It's just 'round the corner, turn left and I'm there  
I'd do anything to be anywhere but here  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die  
If I could kidnap an angel  
  
Now the parking attendant knows my first name  
These long green hallways all look the same  
There's four elevators, one goes to that floor  
I brace myself when I get to the door  
I close my eyes and take a deep breath  
Then sit down beside your hospital bed  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die  
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel  
  
He'd say the word, he'd tear down these walls  
People laughing like children through these hospital halls  
There'd be no more tears, there'd be no more blood  
There'd be nothing but smiles, nothing but love  
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel

Yesterdays are eating me alive

You tried to read me but my words got in the way  
The music's over but the dance has just begun

At the broken hearts that don't come back  
'Cause the train has left the station with my pain  
Let them forget my name, oh  
  
I'm on a last chance train  
  
Sitting here I smoke my nineteenth cigarette  
Now all that's left are ashes, butts and my regrets  
It's your taste that I just can't forget  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
I'm on a last chance train  
  
Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks  
At the broken hearts that don't come back  
We'll be laughing at them, crying in the rain  
It's you and I again, oh  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
I'm on a last chance train  
Leave a flower at the station  
I know my destination  
Love bring me home again

To a pawn on a Christmas Day  
When the New York Times  
Say God is dead and war's begun.  
Alvin Tostig Has a son today.

Take a balloon and go sailing,  
While Levon, Levon slowly dies.

There ain't no day that's different from the day you know that  
Life's too short for days like these

Minding my own business in a restaurant  
Trying to get some dinner but then guess what?  
Some chick got there I slept with, threw her drink in my face  
And then her ugly brother kicked my ass all over the place

I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
What can I do, what can I say, to get her back,  
Alone I wait before my train comes runnin' down the tracks  
Heaven knows that I'd wait if God were to say that you would come  
I guess you can say it's the price that you pay for holdin' on  
  
I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
If you want me, if you need me, I'll be there,  
If you want me, please believe me, I'll be waiting  
  
I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night

My life is getting clearer  
The sunset sighs and slowly disappears  
These trinkets once were treasure  
Life changes like the weather  
You grow up, grow old, or you hit the road 'round here  
So I drive (Drive, drive)  
Watching white lines passing by  
With my plastic dashboard Jesus  
Waiting there to greet us

Hey, hey  
I finally found my way  
Said goodbye to yesterday  
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on this lost highway  
Yeah, I'm busting loose, I'm lettin' go  
Out on this open road  
It's independence day on this lost highway  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
  
Don't know where I'm going  
But I know where I've been  
I'm afraid of going back again

And waiting there to greet us  
Is my plastic dashboard Jesus

Oh patron saint of lonely souls  
Tell this boy which way to go  
Guide the car, you've got the keys  
Farewell to mediocrity  
Kicking off the cruise control  
And turning up the radio  
Got just enough religion  
And a half a tank of gas  
Come on  
Let's go  
  
I finally found my way  
Said goodbye to yesterday  
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on this lost highway  
I'm busting loose, I'm lettin' go

It's independence day on this lost highway

Faces in the crowd, they stare at me  
Yours is the only one I wanted to see  
My heart cries out for sympathy  
But I need to hold you next to me  
And it won't be long, baby  
Maybe tomorrow  
These hotel rooms they're all the same  
Only the number on the door will be changed  
Lord I gotta do me one more show  
Then it's into the bus and off we go  
Should have talked to you  
Well I don't have to try  
When I find the music in your eyes  
And I'm telling myself that we'll take that ride, baby

Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night  
Staying out too late with all my friends  
You found me passed out in the yard again  
  
You cried, I tried  
To stretch the truth, but didn't lie  
It's not so bad when you think about it

This is the story of El Lute  
A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal  
Because he was poor  
But he refused to accept his fate  
And today his honor has been restored  
  
He was only nineteen  
When was sentenced to die  
For something that somebody else did  
And blamed on El Lute  
Then they changed it to life  
And so he could escape  
From then only chased him  
And searched for him day and night  
All over Spain  
But the search was in vain  
For El Lute  
  
He had only seen the dark side of life  
The man they called El Lute  
And he wanted a home  
Just like you and like me  
In a country where all would be free  
Though he taught himself  
To read and to write  
It didn't help El Lute  
He was one who had dared to escape overnight  
They had to find  
El Lute  
  
Soon the fame of his tale  
Spread like wild fire  
All over the land  
Were the prize on his head  
People still gave him bread  
And they gave him a hand  
For they knew he was right  
And his fight was their fight  
  
No one gave you a chance  
In the Spain of those days  
On was every place  
They had put up the face of El Lute  
And he robbed where he could  
Just like once Robin Hood  
They finally caught him  
And that seemed the end  
But they caught him in vain  
Cause a change came for Spain  
And El Lute  
  
He had only seen the dark side of life  
And then freedom really came to his land  
And also to El Lute  
Now he walks in the line  
Of a sunny new day  
The man they call El Lute

Who said he had some friends back east  
So why don't you come along  
Well we can help you at least

They didn't even bluff  
  
'Bout a year has come and gone  
And left me standing here  
Thinking how it could have been

Trampled on my pride

Boney M.,He Was A Steppenwolf,/b/boney+m/he+was+a+steppenwolf_20022501.html,"Come on and listen to my tale  
It's a strange and sorry tale  
That's gonna rock you  
About a man, the drifting kind  
Let the story now unwind  
It's gonna shock you  
  
Some people said he was a ghost  
Wouldn't want to be his host  
Or just to meet him  
And if he ever came their way  
They'd be sticks and stones, I'd say  
That would grieve him  
  
He was a steppenwolf, a lost and lonely one  
He was a steppenwolf, forever on the run  
He was a steppenwolf, with a forgotten past  
He was a steppenwolf, who found a love at last  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
The girl he met was out-of-sight  
Though she walked the streets at night  
He didn't mind it  
She seemed as happy as a song  
And if anything was wrong  
He didn't find it  
  
They used to laugh and dance and drink  
And not ever did he think of a payday  
No matter where they ever were  
Every day he spent with her was a hey-day  
  
He was a steppenwolf, and not a handsome man  
He was a steppenwolf, who didn't know her plan  
He was a steppenwolf, not very bright at all  
He was a steppenwolf, just riding for a fall  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
One day she said ""it's time you knew  
That I started up with you  
For just one reason  
You're gonna do just what I want  
'cause there's something that I want  
And I ain't teasing  
My life is empty all around  
Nothing that I ever found  
Would fulfill me  
So for a while I'll be with you  
When I say that we're through  
You must kill me!""  
  
He was a steppenwolf, he cried ""it isn't fair""  
He was a steppenwolf, ""you know how much I care""  
He was a steppenwolf, she said ""this is the deal""  
He was a steppenwolf, he saw this was for real  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
He was a steppenwolf, they spent a long last night  
He was a steppenwolf, and with a smile she died  
He was a steppenwolf, a lost and lonely one  
He was a steppenwolf, forever on the run  
He was a steppenwolf

For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.  
And then they found a little nook, in a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold 'n' dark, Mary's little boy was born.

I saw that movie, ""Mutiny on theBounty""

So many nights I woke up out of adream  
A dream of blue seas, white sands,  
Paradies birds, butterflies, and  
Beautiful warm-hearted girls.

Malaika,

With all of my heart  
I will always be faithful and true,  
Yeah true.  
But now as I grew older  
The burning desire became so strong  
That I bought a tiket to fly home  
And then I found you  
And we found an eternal love  
Right from the beginning.  
The stars falling down from the Lagoon of gold,  
The palms swaying under the moon,  
We were swimming out into the  
Crystal sea,  
In that fateful night I thought to  
Myself  
I'll do everthing I can, save  
Every dime,  
And one day I'll return,  
And then I'll stay forever, forever.

When you serve her a little tenderness

Just the way a woman's mind, well she has no name  
She has no shame, she just loves you

Bonnie Raitt,Circle Dance,/b/bonnie+raitt/circle+dance_20022596.html,"I don't' know why it should be so hard  
Givin' up this circle dance  
Worn out steps from long ago  
Don't give love a chance  
It's a bitter heirloom handed down  
These twisted parts we play  
  
I'm not her and you're not him  
It just comes out that way  
Can't go back to make things right  
Though I wish I'd understood  
Time has made things clearer now  
We did the best we could  
  
I'll be home soon, that's what you'd say  
And a little kid believes  
After a while I learned that love  
Must be a thing that leaves  
I tried so hard just to hold you near  
Was as good as I could be  
  
Even when I had you here  
You stayed so far from me  
Can't go back to make things right  
Though I wish I'd understood  
Time has made things clearer now  
  
You did the best you could  
Now that this has occurred to me  
I just wanted you to know  
I've been too faithful all my life  
It's time to let you go

Bonnie Raitt,Come To Me,/b/bonnie+raitt/come+to+me_20022609.html,"All I ever wanted  
Was a love to be true  
More than just enough to get me by  
I want a love to see me through  
  
I don't need another well spent night  
Another clever, sideways glance  
I wanna look my baby in the eye  
And know there's nothin' left to chance  
  
Well if you're tired of being lonely  
Beat up and confused  
Darlin' there is only  
One thing you can do  
Come to me  
I'll be the one who's waiting  
Come to me  
I got what you need  
Won't you come to me  
There won't be no hesitating  
I know what you mean to me  
  
I'm gonna hold out for the one I want  
Ain't gonna settle for less  
Cause the kind of love I'm lookin' for, baby  
You can't fake, you can't finesse  
  
I ain't lookin' for the kind of man, baby  
Can't stand a little shaky ground  
He'll give me fire and tenderness  
And got the guts to stick around  
  
So if you're tired of bein' lonely  
Beat up and confused  
Darlin' there is only  
One thing you can do  
Come to me  
I got what you need  
Come to me  
Won't be no hesitating  
I know what you mean to me

You give me kisses  
You bring me moons and stars  
That shine so high up in the sky  
My heart is beating wild and crazy  
  
Hope that I can find  
A cure for this love  
Could be you want me  
Could be you care  
Could be the words you say,  
Are things I just want to hear  
  
You me nervous, got me shaking  
Maybe I can find  
A cure for this love  
La la la la  
  
Doctor, doctor  
Give me healing, so I can stop this feeling  
It's getting so much stronger  
And I just can't go on much longer  
  
Doctor please  
Find me a way out of love  
When the phone rings  
And no one answers  
  
The letters comeback saying  
""Lover cannot be found""  
Don't go looking, don't bother searching  
You see it's 'cause your baby  
Found herself a cure for love  
La la la la

See the woman inside the girl  
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world

There are oceans in my eyes that you can't see  
And my arms reach out for you into the dark  
I feel your skin where my nails left their mark

I'm drowning in a river of my tears  
When all my will is gone you hold me sway  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
You pulled me like the moon  
Pulls on the tide  
You know just where I keep my better side  
  
What days have come to keep us far apart  
A broken promise or a broken heart  
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
Come the night you're only what I want  
Come the night you could be my confidant  
  
I see you the street and in company  
Why don't you come and rest your mind with me  
I'm living for the night we steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
I need you at the dimming of the day

Darlin' do you ever see  
Some situation somewhere, somehow  
Triggers your memory  
And do you ever wonder  
What became of all the time  
Honey, do I ever, ever cross your mind  
  
Do you ever want to know  
Do all dreams go on endlessly  
Or do they just run down somehow  
And gradually become the custody  
Of that melancholy jailer for the time, oh no  
Do I ever, darlin', ever cross your mind  
Do I ever cross your mind  
Uninvited  
When you're lonely  
Or does it only happen to me  
Darlin', do you ever want to know  
What became of all the time  
I wanna know, do I ever, ever cross your mind  
Oh, baby, baby  
  
Little darlin'  
Do you ever wonder  
What became of all the time  
Please tell me, do I ever, ever cross your mind  
Do I ever, ever cross your mind

Than you ever have returned

Now solitude is fine  
When you really need it  
When your soul is dry  
Sometimes loneliness can feed it  
When you need a lover  
You know there's nothing else will do  
When you need love most  
You know it turns it's back on you  
  
Oh, I can make it through without your company  
I only wish I knew why you won't comfort me  
I thought that I could count on you  
To hear me crying out  
I guess that's one comfort  
I will learn to do without  
  
Falling love too easily  
But never quite so fast  
So you are not the first and, lord  
You sure won't be the last  
The thing about the situation  
That makes me feel so sad
