Bonnie Raitt,Louise,/b/bonnie+raitt/louise_20022670.html,"Well they all said Louise was not half bad  
It was written on the walls and window shades  
And how she'd act the little girl  
A deceiver, don't believe her that's her trade  
Sometimes a bottle of perfume,  
Flowers and maybe some lace  
Men brought Louise ten cent trinkets  
Their intentions were easily traced  
Yes and everybody knew at times she cried  
But women like Louise they get by  
  
Well everybody thought it kind of sad  
When they found Louise in her room  
They'd always put her down below their kind  
Still some cried when she died this afternoon  
Louise rode home on the mail train  
Somewhere to the south I heard it said  
Too bad it ended so ugly,  
Too bad she had to go this way  
Ah but the wind is blowing cold tonight  
So good night Louise, good night

Who'll risk their own self respect  
In the name of desire?  
Who'll regret everything they've done  
And who will get the bill?  
  
Lovers will  
Who'll hurt each other all the time  
And never give it a thought?  
Who'll lie about where they've been  
And hope they never get caught?  
Who'll say each other's kisses  
No longer thrill?  
Lovers will  
Lovers will do almost anything  
  
For the thrill that only love can bring  
If love is a healer, who'll be the first ones ill?  
Lovers will  
  
Who'll never know what they've got  
Until it's just about gone?  
And whose arms will gather up what's left  
To carry on?  
  
And who'll stalk that little bit of love  
That hasn't been killed?

I don't believe I'm able

You say you're tired, well so am I  
Baby you've got to try and  
Meet halfway or we ain't gonna make it, baby  
Meet halfway if you want to get it right  
Meet halfway cause I ain't gonna take it, baby  
Meet halfway in the middle of the night  
Our love is kind of stalled, baby  
  
But it ain't about the sex  
I'd trade the roses and the negligees  
If we could just connect  
I go deeper when you look into my eyes  
There's a place where neither one of us can hide  
And it's up to us to reinvent the game  
Love it when you call my name and  
Meet halfway, ain't no doubt about it, baby  
Meet halfway, and we're halfway home  
Meet halfway, got to scream and shout it, baby  
Meet me halfway and I'll shake you to the bone

From the bed I can't get used to  
It's these little hours in the dark, I dread  
As I spend my first night alone without you  
  
Honey, half of me has gone away  
With all the love I learned to cling to  
Tomorrow I'll have to find another way  
To live the rest of my life alone without you  
  
You taught me how to live  
How to be myself  
And how to give  
Oh, but now it's you  
Who's given up on giving  
  
You've lost the thing, no one to teach  
Changing and now you're out of reach  
And my life tonight just don't seem worth living  
No, no  
  
I've been sitting learning how to read  
Cause back in school I never liked to  
It's just one of those little things I'm gonna need  
As I put my life together, baby, without you

Bonnie Raitt,My Opening Farewell,/b/bonnie+raitt/my+opening+farewell_20022671.html,"A lady stands before an open window  
Looking so far away  
She can almost feel the southern winds blow  
Gently touching his restless day  
  
He turns from his window to me  
Sad smile his apology  
Sad eyes reaching to the door  
  
Daylight loses to another evening  
Still he spares me words goodbye  
Sits alone beside me fighting his feelings  
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry  
  
Suddenly it's so hard to find  
The sound of the words to speak his troubled mind  
So I'm offering ease to him as if to be kind  
  
There's a train every day  
Leading either way  
There's a world you know  
There's a way to go  
I soon believe it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
A child's drawings left there on the table  
And a woman's silk is lying on the floor  
I would keep them here if I were able  
To lock you safe behind it's open door  
  
Suddenly it's so clear to me  
That I'd ask you to see what you may never see  
Now my kind words find their way back to me  
  
There's a train every day  
Leading either way  
There's world you know  
Got a way to go  
I soon believe it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
This is my opening farewell.

Bonnie Raitt,Nick Of Time,/b/bonnie+raitt/nick+of+time_20022625.html,"A friend of mine she cries at night,  
And she calls me on the phone  
Sees babies everywhere she goes  
And she wants one of her own.  
She's waited long enough she says  
And still she can't decide  
Pretty soon she'll have to choose and it tears her up inside  
She's scared, scared she'll run out of time.  
  
I see my folks, they're getting old,  
And I watch their bodies change  
I know they see the same in me,  
And it makes us both feel strange  
No matter how you tell yourself,  
It's what we all go through  
Those eyes are pretty hard to take when they're staring' back at you.  
Scared to run out of time.  
  
[Chorus]  
When did the choices get so hard?  
With so much more at stake.  
Life gets mighty precious when there's less of it to waste.  
Hummmm  
Scared to run out of time.  
  
Just when I thought I'd had enough  
And all my tears were shed  
No promise left unbroken,  
There were no painful words unsaid.  
You came along and showed me  
How to leave it all behind  
You opened up my heart again and then much to my surprise.  
  
I found love, baby,  
Love in the nick of time.  
  
I found love, darling,  
Love in the nick of time  
  
I found love, baby,  
Love in the nick of time.

This time it's grave.  
I kept track of all the love that I gave him  
And on paper, well, it looked pretty good  
He left a note that said he couldn't stay here  
As if I could...  
I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name  
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.  
One of these days I thought we'd get it together  
After all that boy was made for me  
But all he left me was a mouth full of feathers  
Little bird got free.  
He always said my love was one sided  
I tried to keep up with supply and demand  
But there was one way that pie was divided  
It was a big piece plan.  
I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name  
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.  
Well, now I'm getting desperate, baby, getting illeagal  
I got the law doggies on my trail  
The hawk's out and I could use an eagle  
To go my bail.  
You say you're itching baby, so go ahead and scratch it  
But if it jumps off, don't look at me  
You swore to God that I couldn't catch it  
But your dog's got fleas.  
I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name  
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.

She's heard it every single day of her life.  
He's got to wonder what she sees in himwhen there's so many others standing in
line.  
She gives herself to him, but he's still on the outside.  
She's alone in this world,  
She's nobody's girl.  
She's nobody's girl.  
  
She shows up at this doorstep in the middle of the night  
Then she disappears for weeks at a time.  
It's just enough to keep him wanting more  
But never is he satisfied.  
  
And he's left to pick up the pieces,  
Wondering what does he do this for.  
She's off in her own little world,  
She's nobody's girl.  
She's nobody's girl.

I didn't even know that I need.  
""She does anything she wants, anytime she wants to,  
With anyone.  
  
You know, she wants it all.  
Still she gets all upset over the least little thing.  
When you hurt her, it makes you feel so small.  
And she's a walking contradiction,  
But I ache for her inside.

And Mexico will never be the same  
It was time to be apart, but somehow it seems this heart of mine  
Will never find a way to live without you

No turnin' back this time  
Well, there's no turnin' back  
No turnin' back  
No use in runnin'  
It's always the same  
You can count on the panic  
It's the faces that change  
We might have a chance  
To get this love off the block  
So take a deep breath  
Let's look under that rock, now baby  
Gonna get into it, baby  
Down where it's tangled and dark, no, no, baby  
Way on into it, baby  
Down where your fears are parked  
Gonna tell the truth about it, baby  
Honey, that's the hardest part  
When we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up  
If we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up, you're gonna give up  
When we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up your heart  
Gonna give up your heart  
Gonna give up your heart  
Ooh babe, gonna give up  
You're gonna give up, you're gonna give up  
Gonna give up, gonna give up your heart

I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death  
You make me feel, like I've never felt

To pull out your bag and fine perfume  
You got me trying to do new things, too  
Just so I could keep up with you

Bonnie Raitt,That Song About The Midway,/b/bonnie+raitt/that+song+about+the+midway_20022664.html,"I met you on a midaway at a fair last year  
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear  
You were playing on the horses  
You were playing on the guitar strings  
  
You were playing like the devil wearing wings  
Wearing wings, you looked so grand, wearing wings  
Do you tie them to your shoulders just to sing  
Can you fly? I hear you can! Can you fly?  
  
Just like an eagle doin' his hunting from the sky  
I followed through a sideshow to another town  
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds  
You were betting on some lover, shootin' out the dice  
  
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice  
Once or twice, I heard ya did, once or twice  
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price  
Now you've packed it in, I heard you did, packed it in  
  
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew you could win?  
Lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news  
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues  
The man calls out the numbers...he sometimes mentions mine  
  
But I feel like I've been working overtime  
Overtime, I've lost my fire, overtime  
And I envy you the valley that you've found  
'Cause I'm midway down the midway  
  
Slowin' down

I write my own forgiveness song  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug  
But it's not your concern  
Another night and it's only right  
I toss and I turn in the bed I made  
  
The wine dark room the flashing eyes  
That hung me from my string of lies  
You said you were numb from wondering  
I guess I wasn't listening  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug  
But you're not concerned  
Another night and it's only right  
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made  
  
With my own hands  
I fashioned this frame  
And into the wood  
I carved out my name  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug  
But you're not concerned  
Another night and it's only right  
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made

If he winks an eye and the bread slice turns to toast  
He's got a lot of what they call the most  
  
You know the boy can't help it  
He was born to please  
And if he's got himself a figure that's just made to squeeze  
Won't you kindly be aware that the boy can't help it  
  
If he mesmerizes each and every one  
And, Lord when he smiles the beefsteak becomes well done  
He even makes my grandma feel like she's twenty one  
  
You know the boy can't help it  
He was born to please  
And if I got to go down to him on bended knees  
It's because I'm hoping, obviously  
That some day his answer will be  
The boy can't help it  
He's in love with me.

You look fine  
  
Then they're fightin' in the backseat

Called to ask if we could talk

That he's about to pop the question any day

Sittin' in their frames  
I see them as babies  
I guess that'll never change

That someday they will find happiness

I would have filled it with love  
If I was able to open my heart you would see  
I'm so happy  
Chorus  
If I was able to live my life (over again)  
I'd share the minutes with you  
If I was able to count the times you bring out the sun  
When I'm feeling down  
If I was able to explain  
How you have opened my eyes  
I sure have tried about thousand times  
I just feel so alive  
Chorus (2x)  
I found the meaning  
I cherish my life  
Now I see everything in colors so bright  
And when it's raining  
I still feel the sun  
So take a good look  
I'm walking clouds

Bosson,Beautiful,/b/bosson/beautiful_10046658.html,"I do believe in fate cause that's how we met  
It was raining and we were soaking wet  
You took the last of cabs on an empty street  
Then you smiled at me and said 'take a seat... '  
  
I said do you believe in love at first sight?  
You said if you give me a reason I might  
Ok, well your hair is wet and your clothes are a mess  
And your makeup is all over your face...  
And still you're so...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Beautiful, so, sweet and just adorable  
You are a miracle, simply irresistible  
You are so beautiful, so, sweet and just adorable  
You are the finest thing that I've seen in my life  
You're everything that I've ever dreamed of  
  
Now it's been seven years 1 month and a day  
Since we met and I'm so happy to say  
Today we'll be man and wife and dedicate  
Our lives to the precious thing we have called love  
  
So now I'm standing here well dressed and prepared  
In a black suit that you told me to wear  
And when you're walking in, you amazing thing,  
You take my breath away...  
Cause you are so.....  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
For richer and poorer till death do us part  
In sickness, in health you are always in my heart  
Till the day when we're old and grey  
I will cherish and love you in every kind of way  
Cause you are so....

Be And it makes me wonder wonder

The only thing I have inside my mind  
Is a picture of you And it's there no  
Matter what I do No matter what I  
Do not know...  
  
I don't know what it is but I think I'm  
Falling in love I don't know what it is  
But when I close my eyes You're the  
One I'm dreaming of I don't know  
What it is but I'm floating in the sky  
I don't know what it is and I sure  
Don't know how But you filled  
My heart with butterflies I'm falling in

Seems like all my problems went  
Away I start to make the most of  
Everyday So I spend them with you  
No one makes me feel the way you  
Do And it makes me wonder wonder  
Wonder about the pain I get inside  
Everytime you're not by my side  
You have opened a door  
I have never felt this way before  
And I want more I don't know....  
  
I don't know what it is....  
  
When we are walking I get to hold  
Your hand And that is making me

Clear blue shy You give me a kiss, I

Bosson,Hard Candy,/b/bosson/hard+candy_20643607.html,"On certain Sundays in November,  
When the whether bothers me,  
I empty draws of other summers,  
Where my shadows used to be,  
She is standing by the water,  
As her smile begins to curl,  
In this or any other summer,  
She is something all together different,  
Never just an ordanairy girl.  
And in the evenings on Long Island,  
When the colours start to fade,  
She wears a silly yellow hat,  
That someone gave her when she stayed,  
I didn't think that she returned it,  
We left New York in a whirl,  
Time expands and then contracts,  
When you are spinning in the grips of someone,  
Who is not an ordanairy girl.  
And when you sleep, you find your mother in the night,  
But she fades just out of sight,  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming,  
And when you wake, the morning covers you with light,  
And it makes you feel alright,  
But its just the same hard candy your remembering again.  
You send your lover off to China,  
Then you awit for her to call,  
You put your girl upon a pedestal,  
And you wait fro her to fall,  
I put my summers back in a letter,  
And I hide it from the world,  
All the regrets you can't forget,  
Are somehow pressed upon the picture,  
In the face of such an ordanairy girl.  
And when you sleep,  
You find your mother in the night,  
But she fades just out of sight,  
So there isn't any sweetness in thee dreaming,  
And when you wake, the morning showers you with light,  
But its just the same hard candy, your remembering again,  
Again, again, again, again.  
And its just the same hard candy your remembering again.  
  
Go ask her to come around,  
And see me late, after dark,  
Don't ask me to go around,  
And wait to see if theres a spark X2

Living day by day like the real rockers do,  
Practice for my break, that is what I'm gonna do!

Some believe in making dead man walk  
Another year and another week, another day  
Time keeps running and everything will be okay x2  
Chorus:  
Everybody need something to believe in  
Everybody need something to put their trust in x2  
Free...believe in what you want  
Free...believe in what you want  
Some might say it's a miracle  
Some might call it the destiny  
Some let god, lead them all the way  
Some would say they believe in me  
Another year and another week, another day  
Time keeps running and everything will be okay x2

Everything is gonna go your day

And the air is just seeting with life...

What a day, when the birds are singing too  
They're singing for you  
What a day, oh oh

In a garden full of blooming trees  
It's so quiet  
You can hear the sound of falling leaves  
Though you close your eyes for a moment  
Light is all that you see...  
  
What a day...  
  
You've been searching  
You've been climbing never give up  
Just to realise  
You've been standing on the mountain top  
Cause the future's gone tomorrow  
But your life is right here today...  
  
What a day...  
  
The future's gone tomorrow  
Life is here today  
Things' gonna go your way

Makes you drop what you used to hold in your heart.

I knew behind my back they'd point and laugh and stare

In my hand  
Now I can see your picture helps retrace  
All the steps we took, places we went to  
Thoughts that we tried, tripping along  
On a love we never understood with no guide  
Many things were taken for granted all along  
Firm foundations never were planted  
All went wrong  
We fell down, and broke in a million pieces  
We couldn't put it all together  
We couldn't put it all together again

London bridge is always fallin' down,  
But there it stood within the heart of town  
Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come  
  
The changes taking place are everywhere  
The centuries past have nothing to compare  
Where they stand, where they trip and fall  
Watch the writing on the wall, on the wall  
  
London bridge is fallin' down at last,  
And so another memory of the past  
Has fell beneath the blade, but soon the dead may be repaid  
  
I know things just can't evolve for all eternity  
The thoughts will leave, will never die, and now so you can see  
  
London bridge is finally fallin' down,  
It packed it up and shipped it outta town  
And though the horror's gone, the memory will linger on  
London bridge is finally fallin' down,  
It used to stand within the heart of town  
Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come  
London bridge is finally fallin' down

Hazel eyes and curly hair  
Have you seen me anywhere  
Look at me  
I'm blending into the wall  
And i wonder if i'm really here at all  
  
Time goes by  
So do i  
But no one blinks an eye  
Mirrors aren't reflecting me  
Laws aren't protecting  
And no one's expecting me  
On the edge  
I feel like i'm going to fall  
And i wonder if i'll never land at well  
  
Loneliness comes and stays  
Torturing nights and days  
People stare but cannot speak  
Hearts are strong  
But tongues are weak  
Maybe all our minds are meek  
Look at me  
I'm fading into the floor  
And wonder if i'm living anymore.

Bread,Lost Without Your Love,/b/bread/lost+without+your+love_20024042.html,"Lost and all alone.  
I always thought that I could make it on my own.  
But since you left I hardly make it through the day.  
My tears get in the way and I need you back to stay.  
  
I wander through the night  
And search the world to find the words to make it right.  
All I want is just the way it used to be  
With you here close to me.  
And I've got to make you see,  
That I'm lost without your love.  
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of.  
And I'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel,  
A touch without a feel.  
I can't believe its real.  
And someday soon I'll wake  
And find my heart won't have to break.  
  
Yes, I'm lost without your love.  
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of.  
All I want is the way it used to be  
I need you here with me.

If we had love before,  
We can have it back once more

I've used and like to pass them on your way

Make what you will of them

And emptiness you've known  
Well, let me reassure you  
Never were you really all alone  
They say in quiet desperation many people cannot see  
They cannot see the simple truth  
That's not the way it has to be  
  
You got to find it for yourself  
God helps the man who helps himself, amen  
I am your friend and I'll lend a helping hand

I'm just reachin' out for you

'Cause every time, time before  
When I open up my eyes

Bread,You Can't Measure The Cost,/b/bread/you+cant+measure+the+cost_20024012.html,"The silken skies that so remind and mesmerize

The downy softness of herself forever lingering  
Behind me  
Never ever has there been  
Nor will ever be again  
One someone to give you love, tenderness and be  
Your friend  
Hanging on till the bitter end  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost  
But it's a heavy loss indeed for those in need.  
  
I've tried to look inside myself  
To find the strength from which to draw from  
The view she saw from.  
Since she tried to go too deep  
Limitations brought her down  
And though I'd like to free her mind  
Visitations bring a frown  
I gotta find the place she found  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost  
But it's a heavy loss to bear when she's not there.  
Where she is no one seems to know  
The silken skies have swallowed her up or so it seems.  
  
The morning mist that melts upon the meadow  
Brings a touch of sorrow  
The one I kissed is all alone  
And may or may not know tomorrow.  
Just an ordinary girl  
To the ordinary eye  
But so much deeper goes the vein  
Like the glittering of gold you want to touch  
Then you gotta hold  
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost.

I'd buy a big house where we both could live  
  
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no  
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show  
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do  
My gift is my song and this one's for you  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue  
Anyway the thing is what I really mean  
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

Want some more?  
You want some more?  
Baby don't go (just don't go)  
Said baby please listen  
Don't you just go  
  
Do you lick your lips?  
When you stand alone  
Well you got no x-ray vision  
Staring through my clothes  
Are you sure that you're prepared  
For what comes serves on it's plate  
Wait a minute  
Oooh, I'm having second thoughts  
See my hearts on fault  
Could you pass my shorts?  
Don't you got a girl?  
Till then  
I'm sorry, you must wait  
Especially since I know
