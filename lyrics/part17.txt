What are we in it for  
Why do we play the game  
Why are we keeping score  
You and I  
You know we were born to fight  
There's so many times before  
Know I should be sure  
Love is war  
Wash my hands  
Trying to understand  
After all the pain  
We'll take another chance  
I just want to close my eyes  
Forget the reasons why  
Lying here on the floor  
All I want is more  
Love is war  
We hurt the ones we love  
But still don't let them go  
We hold on to the words  
You and I would know  
All these tears are in my eyes  
That's where they'll stay  
It's just easier that way  
Then I turn  
Say that I'm not the one  
I don't feel the sting  
I don't feel anything  
I've gone numb  
From all the damage done  
But I'm lying here on the floor  
So many times before  
Love is war  
Lying here on the floor  
All I want is more  
Love is war

Early morning, she wakes up  
Knock, knock, knock on the door  
It's time for make-up, perfect smile  
It's you they're all waiting for  
They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"" And they say  
  
[Chorus]  
She's so lucky, she's a star  
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking  
If there's nothing missing in my life  
Then why do these tears come at night?  
  
Lost in an image, in a dream  
But there's no one there to wake her up  
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning  
But tell me what happens when it stops?  
They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""  
And they say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
""Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!""  
""I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky.""  
""Oh my god, here she comes!""  
  
Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?  
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?  
If there's nothing missing in her life  
Why do tears come at night?

And become a part of their crew

And I'm up against the truth

Or will you be taken too?  
  
You'll find it in rebellion

'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
'Cause everyone's yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
Be wary of others  
The ones closest to you  
The poison they feed you  
And the voodoo that they do  
But in rebellion there's a sparkle of truth  
Don't just stand there  
Do what you got to do  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
You'll finally start breathing  
They're not believing what they're seeing  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
You'll find it so compelling  
With everyone yelling  
'Cause your soul you're not selling  
'Cause you're rebellion  
  
The eye that is deceiving is the one trapping us in  
I'm fighting a losing battle and my patience is wearing thin  
But in rebellion there's a glimmer of light  
And nobody claims the crown without some sacrifice  
  
You'll find it in rebellion  
You'll finally start breathing  
They're not believing what they're seeing

And I'm wonderin' what's that something that you won't give  
I started loving you but I gotta stop  
You got me mostly waitin' for that other shoe to drop

You just smile and tell me ""Baby there ain't nothin' wrong""  
In your smile there's a sign in red  
It said ""Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead""

I was schooled down and dirty  
Signed a note back to town  
It was there that the workers slaved all week  
Waiting for payday to come around  
  
Break out, come on if you're coming  
Cause baby i just can't stay  
I want to take out the walls of this joint  
I want to blow this town away

For any of the stupid things that i've done  
  
For the ones who once had a notion  
A notion it was good to be alive  
Feel the spark, the rush of emotion

I want to dream, that i got a place  
I want to scream in somebody's face  
Make it seem, get out of this muddy race  
All night long  
  
Well all little kings lose their thrones tonight  
All you little pretty things better learn to sleep alone tonight  
It was down in the cool dirty living  
With the man with the master plan  
Some girl who can beg forgiveness  
And a ticket to the promised land  
  
Down where they'll tear your guts out  
Making out what you're all about  
Making while we were blasting like a ??

Want out to the outside

I want to shout i'm bound for nothing  
I want to shout about something too

I wanna win what ain't ever been won

Bruce Springsteen,Born To Run,/b/bruce+springsteen/born+to+run_20025020.html,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream  
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines  
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,  
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line  
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back  
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap  
We gotta get out while we're young  
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run  
  
Yes, girl we were  
  
Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend  
I want to guard your dreams and visions  
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims  
And strap your hands 'cross my engines  
Together we could break this trap  
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back  
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire  
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider  
But I gotta know how it feels  
I want to know if love is wild  
Babe I want to know if love is real  
  
Oh, can you show me  
  
Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard  
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors  
And the boys try to look so hard  
The amusement park rises bold and stark  
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist  
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight  
In an everlasting kiss  
  
One, two, three, four!  
  
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive  
Everybody's out on the run tonight  
But there's no place left to hide  
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness  
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul  
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when  
We're gonna get to that place  
Where we really wanna go  
And we'll walk in the sun  
But till then tramps like us  
Baby we were born to run  
  
Oh honey, tramps like us  
Baby we were born to run  
  
Come on Wendy, tramps like us  
Baby we were born to run

And say ""Catherine, this has all been some mistake""

Bruce Springsteen,Cautious Man,/b/bruce+springsteen/cautious+man_20025275.html,"Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road  
He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code  
When something caught his eye he'd measure his need  
And then very carefully he'd proceed  
  
Billy met a young girl in the early days of May  
It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away  
In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim  
He'd lay back in her arms and laugh at what had happened to him  
  
On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the
word fear  
And in which hand he held his fate was never clear  
Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride  
And with his own hands built a great house down by the riverside  
  
Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right  
He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights  
Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray  
For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay  
  
One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name  
She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep, a thousand miles away  
He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode  
When he got there he didn't find nothing but road  
  
Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name  
Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain  
At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on
her skin so white  
Filling their room with the beauty of God's fallen light

Headin' down towards them old tracks  
I swore I'd come and get her  
But I know I ain't never goin' back  
  
""there's nights I can't sleep  
No matter how hard I try  
So from my window I watch the moonlight  
Fall on the far hillside  
  
""I imagine I put on my jacket,  
Go down to this little roadside bar  
Pick a stranger and spin around the dance floor  
To a mexican guitar""

Bruce Springsteen,"Chimes Of Freedom - At Stockholm, Sweden",/b/bruce+springsteen/chimes+of+freedom+at+stockholm+sweden_20831384.html,"Well, far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sound  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom crashing  
  
Yeah, flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight  
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night  
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well, in the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden here while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain  
Dissolved into the wild bales of lightning  
  
Yeah, tolling for the rebel, yeah, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaken  
Yeah tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Alright now  
  
And then through a cloud like curtain in a far off corner flashed  
As the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Well, electric light still struck like arrows  
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
  
Well, tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
And for each un-harmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well, starry-eyed and laughing, I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look  
Spellbound and swallowed as the tolling ended  
  
Yeah, tolling for the aching ones whose wounds  
Cannot be nursed for the countless confused  
Accused, misused, strung out ones and worse  
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
(Yeah)  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Alright, now, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Well, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Well, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Well, whoa, whoa, whoa

Hope I can remember where our car's parked

We sit a while in my front yard

Oh I wish, I'd never have to let this moment go

Was trying their best to, to forget  
The way those outlaws and desperadoes  
Right from the cheapest to the best  
Rode in on ponies made of skin and bones  
Keep up their rusty guns and went back home  
And the governor was sent down from population control  
And marshall all was past  
Riverboat gamblers put their money on faith  
For the time for hope they passed  
  
In the cold blue light of the desert night  
There was a thousand starry ships  
And men came down from still I don't now where  
With death on their fingertips  
Now there's no more kings in texas  
I swear they rounded up each and everyone  
And old atlanta canastoga  
Reached from the rocky mountains into the old dead sun  
Now anna maria walks the blames alone  
The last of a struggling people  
She thinks of all those outlaws who wanted to reach for the skies  
And got stuck up on a steamboat  
Oh, you can hear them crying  
Good god, I think they're dying  
In the wind you can hear them sighing

Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes,  
Man takes his lunch, walks out in the morning light,  
It's the working, the working, just the working life.  
  
Through the mansions of fear, through the mansions of pain,  
I see my daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain,  
Factory takes his hearing, factory gives him life,  
The working, the working, just the working life.  
  
End of the day, factory whistle cries,  
Men walk through these gates with death in their eyes.  
And you just better believe, boy,  
Somebody's gonna get hurt tonight,  
It's the working, the working, just the working life.

Now rooms that once were so bright are filled with the coming night, darlin'

You say it's not easy for you  
And that you've been so lonely  
While other girls go out doing what they want to do  
You say that you miss the nights whe we'd go out dancing  
The days when you and I walked as two  
Well girl, I miss them too  
Oh I swear that I do  
Oh girl  
  
Now baby I don't want to be just another useless memory holding you tight  
Or just some other ghost out on the street to whom you stop and politely speak  
When you pass on by vanishing into the night  
Left to vanish into the night  
No baby

There's such a distance between you and your family.  
Just can't see things from the same point of view.  
  
Papa wants a lawyer and mama she wants an author,  
And all you want is for them to want you.  
  
Well, I saw lot of bad signs and we had some real bad timesback on the east
coast.  
And I guess you could say it took california to bring us close.  
There was a lot of hard livin' and some stone cold women on the east coast.  
And I saw my papa turn away when I need him the most.  
And california, she's an angel.  
Lo, so heavenly dressed  
And the pacific she's a woman  
The lord must have loved her best.  
I got a california rainbow to come give them thunder clouds a rest  
And the mountain is my friend now, she put me to her test  
Well you know every father has dreams and schemes for his own kid.  
And dreaming it ain't been declaired no capital crime  
But I just hope when I grow up to have my own kids  
I'll love them all I can and let 'em make their own minds  
Now you know how a mother can hold the son through understanding.  
And my father he once held me close by crying.  
Whoa, and my mama's love it don't ever leave me standing.  
And papa's love it just leaves me smiling.  
Whoa, and my mama she's a rainbow,  
Gotta see hen on sunday when she's dressed  
Whoa, and my papa he's a good man, he gives me and mama his best.  
Whoa, my mama she's a rainbow, come to give them thunder clouds a rest.  
And my family is my friend now california put us through her test.

You say you don't love me, girl you can't hide your desire

A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart  
My nerves all jumpin' actin' like a fool

Gonna spend the night at the drive-in with the one that I love  
At dusk the stars all appear on the screen

But tonight's no dream, Frankie, I can feel myself too  
Well now and forever my love is for you  
  
Walk softly tonight little stranger

Talk softly tonight, little angel  
You make all my dream worlds come true  
  
Well lately I've been standing out in the freezing rain  
Readin' them want ads out on Chelsea Road  
I'm winging down the street in search of new games  
Hustling through these nightlights' diamond glow  
Well Frankie I don't know what I'm gonna find  
Maybe nothing at all, maybe a world I can call mine  
Shining like these streetlights down here on the strand  
Bright as the rain in the palm of your hand  
  
Walk softly tonight, little stranger  
Into the shadows where lovers go  
Talk softly to me, little angel  
Whisper your secrets so soft and low

To think his niece would be a bride  
  
Well, Uncle Rat rode off to town  
To buy his niece a wedding gown  
  
Where will the wedding supper be  
Way down yonder in a hollow tree  
  
What will the wedding supper be  
A fried misquito and a roasted flea  
  
First to come in were to little ants  
Fixing around to have a dance  
  
Next to come in was a bumble bee  
Bouncing a fiddle on his knee  
  
Next to come in was a fat sassy lad  
Thinks himself as big as his dad  
  
Thinks himself a man indeed  
Because he chews the tobacco weed  
  
And next to come in was a big tomcat  
He swallowed the frog and the mouse and the rat

Bruce Springsteen,Galveston Bay,/b/bruce+springsteen/galveston+bay_20025044.html,"Fifteen years Le Bing Son  
Fought side by side with the Americans  
In the mountains and deltas of Vietnam  
  
In '75 Saigon fell  
And he left his command  
And brought his family to the promised land  
  
Seabrook Texas and the small towns  
In the Gulf of Mexico  
It was delta country and reminded him of home  
  
He worked as a machinist, put his money away  
And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin  
And together they harvested Galveston Bay  
  
In the mornin' 'fore the sun come up  
He'd kiss his sleepin' daughter  
Steer out through the channel  
And casts his nets into the water  
  
Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company  
In the highlands of Quang Tri  
He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai  
And shipped home in '68  
  
There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds  
In a boat that'd been his father's  
In the morning he'd kiss his sleeping son  
And cast his nets into the water  
  
Billy sat in front of his TV as the south fell  
And the Communists rolled into Saigon  
He and his friends watched as the refugees came  
Settle on the same streets and worked the coast they grew up on  
  
Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk  
Of America for Americans  
Someone said, ""You want 'em out, you got to burn 'em out""  
And brought in the Texas klan  
  
One humid Texas night there were three shadows on the harbor  
Come to burn the Vietnamese boats into the sea  
In the fire's light shots rang out  
Two Texans lay dead on the ground  
Le stood with a pistol in his hand  
  
A jury acquitted him in self defense  
As before the judge he did stand  
But as he walked down the courthouse steps  
Billy said ""My friend, you're a dead man""  
  
One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside  
Billy stood in the shadows  
His K-bar knife in his hand  
And the moon slipped behind the clouds  
  
Le lit a cigarette, the bay was as still as glass  
As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket  
Took a breath and let him pass  
  
In the early darkness Billy rose up  
Went into the kitchen for a drink of water  
Kissed his sleeping wife  
Headed into the channel  
And casts his nets into the water  
  
Of Galveston Bay

I was walking in, he was walking out  
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks  
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days  
  
Well there's a girl that lives up the block  
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads  
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by  
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed  
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up  
I guess it's two years gone by now  
We just sit around talking about the old times,  
She says when she feels like crying  
She starts laughing thinking about  
  
Glory days well they'll pass you by  
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye  
Glory days, glory days  
  
Think I'm going down to the well tonight  
And I'm going to drink till I get my fill  
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it  
But I probably will  
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture  
A little of the glory, well time slips away  
And leaves you with nothing mister but  
Boring stories of

Untouched

And a little of that human touch  
  
Baby, in a world without pity  
Do you think what I'm askin's too much  
I just want to feel you in my arms  
Share a little of that human touch  
Share a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Share a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Give me a little of that human touch

Bruce Springsteen,Hunter Of Invisible Game,/b/bruce+springsteen/hunter+of+invisible+game_21075395.html,"I hauled myself up out of a ditch  
I built me an ark out of gopher wood and pitch  
Sat down by the roadside and waited on the rain  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Well I woke last night to the heavy clicking and clack  
And a scarecrow on fire along the railroad tracks  
There were empty cities and burning plains  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
We all come up a little short and we go down hard  
These days I spend my time skipping through the dark  
Through the empires of dust I chant your name  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Through the bone yard we rattled and black smoke we rolled on  
Down into the valley where the beast has his throne  
I sing my song and I sharpen my blade  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Strength is vanity and time is illusion  
I feel you breathing, the rest is confusion  
Your skin touches mine, what else to explain  
Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game  
  
Now pray for yourself and that you may not fall  
When the hour of deliverance comes on us all  
When high hope and faith and courage and trust  
Can rise or vanish like dust and dust  
Now there's a kingdom of love waiting to be reclaimed  
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game  
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game  
Honey, I'm the hunter of the invisible game

Bruce Springsteen,Incident On 57th Street,/b/bruce+springsteen/incident+on+57th+street_20025201.html,"Spanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night  
With bruised arms and broken rhythm and a beat-up old Buick but dressed just
like dynamite  
He tried sellin' his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street  
But they said, ""Johnny, it falls apart so easily, and you know hearts these
days are cheap""  
And the pimps swung their axes and said, ""Johnny, you're a cheater""  
And the pimps swung their axes and said, ""Johnny, you're a liar""  
And from out of the shadows came a young girl's voice, said, ""Johnny, don't
cry""  
Puerto Rican Jane, oh, won't you tell me, what's your name?  
I want to drive you down to the other side of town  
Where paradise ain't so crowded and there'll be action goin' down on Shanty
Lane tonight  
All the golden-heeled fairies in a real bitch-fight  
Pull .38's and kiss their girls goodnight  
  
Goodnight, it's alright, Jane  
Now let them black boys in to light the soul flame  
We may find it out on the street tonight, baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe  
  
Well, like a cool Romeo he made his moves, oh, she looked so fine  
Like a late Juliet, she knew she'd never be true but then, she really didn't
mind  
Upstairs a band was playin' and the singer was singin' something about going
home  
She whispered, ""Spanish Johnny, you can leave me tonight, but just don't leave
me alone""  
And Johnny cried, ""Puerto Rican Jane, word is down, the cops have found the
vein""  
Them barefoot boys left their homes for the woods  
Them little barefoot street boys, they said their homes ain't no good  
They left the corners, threw away their switchblade knives and kissed each
other goodbye  
  
Johnny was sittin' on the fire escape, watchin' the kids playin' down the
street  
He called down, ""Hey little heroes, summer's long, but I guess it ain't very
sweet around here anymore""  
Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat  
Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on  
And the sister prays for lost souls, then breaks down in the chapel after
everyone's gone  
  
Jane moves over to share her pillow but opens her eyes to see Johnny up and
putting his clothes on  
She says, ""Those romantic young boys, all they ever want to do is fight  
Those romantic young boys, they're callin' through the window  
Hey, Spanish Johnny, you want to make a little easy money tonight?""  
  
And Johnny whispered, ""Goodnight, it's all tight, Jane  
I'll meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane  
We may find it out on the street tonight, now, baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe""  
Goodnight, it's alright, Jane  
I'm gonna meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane  
We can find it out on the street tonight, now, baby  
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe

Somewhere up the stairs, into the fire

You lay your hand on me  
Then walked into the darkness of your smoky grave

I need your kiss, but love and duty called you someplace higher  
Somewhere up the stairs, into the fire

Bruce Springsteen,Johnny 99,/b/bruce+springsteen/johnny+99_20025114.html,"Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month  
Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none  
He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine  
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99  
  
Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop  
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top  
When an off-duty cop snuck up on him from behind  
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99  
  
Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown  
He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down  
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime  
Prison for ninety eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99  
A fist fight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away  
His mama stood up and shouted ""Judge don't take my boy this way""  
Well son you got a statement you'd like to make  
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away  
  
Now judge I had debts no honest man could pay  
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they were gonna take my house away  
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man  
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand  
  
Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead  
So if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head  
Then sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time  
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that killin' line

Bruce Springsteen,Jungleland,/b/bruce+springsteen/jungleland_20025021.html,"The Rangers had a homecoming  
In Harlem late last night  
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine  
Over the Jersey state line  
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge  
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain  
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants  
Together they take a stab at romance  
And disappear down Flamingo Lane  
  
Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo  
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl  
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows  
Always quiet, holding hands  
From the churches to the jails  
Tonight all is silence in the world  
As we take our stand  
Down in Jungleland  
  
The midnight gang's assembled  
And picked a rendezvous for the night  
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign  
That brings this fair city light  
Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike  
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley  
Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night  
The street's alive as secret debts are paid  
Contacts made, they flash unseen  
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades  
Hustling for the record machine  
The hungry and the hunted  
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands  
That face off against each other out in the street  
Down in Jungleland  
  
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage  
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays  
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners  
Desperate as the night moves on  
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone  
  
Beneath the city, two hearts beat  
Soul engines running through a night so tender  
In a bedroom locked in whispers  
Of soft refusal and then surrender  
In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down  
As shots echo down them hallways in the night  
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away  
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light  
  
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz  
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy  
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all  
They just stand back and let it all be  
And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment  
And try to make an honest stand  
But they wind up wounded, not even dead  
Tonight in Jungleland

We marked Truth Or Consequences on our map  
A voice drifted up from the radio  
We saw the voice from long ago

Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
  
The kids asleep in the backseat  
We're just countin' the miles you and me  
We don't measure the blood we've drawn anymore  
We just stack the bodies outside the door  
  
The wise men were all fools  
What to do  
  
The sun sets in flames as the city burns  
Another day gone down as the night turns  
And I hold you here in my heart  
As things fall apart  
  
A downtown window flushed with light  
Faces of the dead at five (faces of the dead at five)  
A martyr's silent eyes  
Petition the drivers as we pass by  
  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break  
Who'll be the last to die  
  
Who'll be the last to die for a mistake  
The last to die for a mistake  
Darlin' your tyrants and kings form the same fate  
Strung up at your city gates  
And you're the last to die for a mistake

Well I did anything just to try to get close to you  
I took it step by step like a man's supposed to  
Tell me now, is this my  
Is this my contrition  
To have the love that I longed for fill me with suspicion  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it's tellin' time, oh my little sister  
Now can I believe the words, the words of love you whisper  
Is my train in vain, has my soul gone to waste  
Am I just a victim of, a victim of my lost faith

Bruce Springsteen,Life Itself,/b/bruce+springsteen/life+itself_20776285.html,"We met down in the valley, where the wine of love and destruction flows  
There in that curve of darkness where flowers of temptation grow  
I left the rest for the others it was you and nothing else  
You felt so good to me baby, as good as life itself  
  
You were life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
I knew you were in trouble, anyone could tell  
You carried your little black book from which all your secrets fell  
You squandered all your riches, your love, your beauty and your wealth  
Like you had no further use for, for life itself  
  
You were life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
Why the things that we treasure most slip away in time  
'Til to the music we grow deaf and to god's beauty blind  
Why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart  
'Til we fall away in our own darkness, stranger to our own hearts  
  
And to life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you  
  
So here's one for the road  
Here's one to your health  
And to life itself, rushing over me  
Life itself, the wind in the black elms  
Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes  
I can't make it without you

Bruce Springsteen,Loose Change,/b/bruce+springsteen/loose+change_20025235.html,"Met her at a friendly little bar down along the coast  
She said it was her birthday so we had us a nice little toast  
Drove around for a while, smoked a few cigarettes  
Took her back to my place, she slipped off her party dress  
She sat for a while on the edge of the bed just talkin'  
Loose change in my pocket  
Loose change in my pocket  
  
Pint of gin in my boot cuff, I'm drivin' for a drink and a dance  
Sittin' on the next stool, miss a little time on her hands  
Yeah I knew she was trouble, but trouble sure was lookin' fine  
And when I pulled her close what I knew kinda slipped my mind  
We lay in bed and watched the moon come up crawling  
Loose change in my pocket  
Loose change in my pocket  
  
I pour another drink, wait for the night to get through  
Stars are burning in that black void so far away and blue  
  
Now I'm sittin' at a red light I feel somethin' tickin' way down  
The night's moving like a slow train crawling through this shithole town  
Got my bags packed in the back and I'm tryin' to get going again  
But red just goes to green and green goes red and then  
Then all I hear's the clock on the dash tick-tocking  
Loose change in my pocket

Bruce Springsteen,Losin' Kind,/b/bruce+springsteen/losin+kind_20241311.html,"My name is frank davis, drive up Dixie 109  
I was out on Highway 17, just south of the camden line  
It was down there in heart of Wilsonville, where I met my fate  
She was standing outside a barroom, said she was waitin' for a date  
but I knew that was just a line  
And I knew I was messin' with the losin' kind  
  
well I knew what we were both doin', and I knew that u cant win  
But when the light turned green, I reached across the seat,popped the lock and
she slid in,  
She said she liked Mexican music, she knew a place if I had the time  
So we had a few drinks and we danced for a while,I pulled her close, she didnt
mind  
And what I knew kinda slipped my mind,  
And I couldnt resist her kiss, with the losin' kind  
  
Well we drove around in my Buick, getting drunk and having fun  
We ended up at the Best Western, out on Highway 101  
It was around 3:00a.m., we went out, to this empty little roadside bar  
It was there the cash register was open, it was there I hit that guy real hard  
But I knew, when I hit him, for a second time,  
that one attracts the other, when there the losin' kind  
  
Well I grabbed her hand to get out of there, then I felt like I was gonna be
sick  
About a half hour later the sleet started comin' down,

Bruce Springsteen,Matamoras Banks,/b/bruce+springsteen/matamoras+banks_10051598.html,"Each year many die crossing the deserts, mountains, and rivers of our southern
border in search of a better life. Here I follow the journey backwards, from
the body at the river bottom, to the man walking across the desert towards the
banks of the Rio Grande.  
  
For two days the river keeps you down  
Then you rise to the light without a sound  
Past the playgrounds and empty switching yards  
The turtles eat the skin from your eyes, so they lay open to the stars  
  
Your clothes give way to the current and river stone  
'Till every trace of who you ever were is gone  
And the things of the earth they make their claim  
That the things of heaven may do the same  
Goodbye, my darling, for your love I give God thanks,  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks  
  
Over rivers of stone and ancient ocean beds  
I walk on sandals of twine and tire tread  
My pockets full of dust, my mouth filled with cool stone  
The pale moon opens the earth to its bones  
I long, my darling, for your kiss, for your sweet love I give God thanks  
The touch of your loving fingertips  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks  
  
Your sweet memory comes on the evenin' wind  
I sleep and dream of holding you in my arms again  
The lights of Brownsville, across the river shine  
A shout rings out and into the silty red river I dive  
I long, my darling, for your kiss, for your sweet love I give God thanks  
A touch of your loving fingertips  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks  
  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros  
Meet me on the Matamoros banks

Once in a million times

Tell me what do I do  
  
And the look that you are givin' me gives me hope to believe

Then you'll see you should be right here with me  
Cause I love everything you do  
That's why I have to take this time baby to tell ya

When you want to do something that's new  
And it seems really, really hard to do  
You feel like quitting, you feel you're through  
Well I have some advice for you  
  
Don't give up  
Keep on trying  
You're gonna make it  
I ain't lying  
Don't give up, don't ever quit  
Try and try and you can do it  
Don't give up, yeah  
  
If you want to catch a ball  
But you're having no luck at all  
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose  
It hits your belly, your chin and toes  
Well, try and try and try again  
Keep on trying until the end  
You put your hands out in the air  
You'll catch the ball  
Yes this I swear  
  
Don't give up,  
Keep on going  
You're on a boat,  
So keep on rowing  
Don't give up, don't ever stop  
Try and try and you'll come out on top  
Don't give up  
  
You got yourself rollerskates  
You put them on  
And you feel great  
You stand up  
Then you fall, don't think you can skate at all  
You get back up, then you trip,  
You skip and tip and slip, and flip  
You try and try and try some more  
Soon you're skating across the floor  
  
Don't give up, keep on moving,  
You're gonna get there, just keep on grooving  
Don't give up, don't pack it in  
Try and try, and you'll win  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no no

How do I end up in the same old place,  
Faced again with the same mistakes,  
So stubborn thinkin I know what is right,  
But life proves me wrong everytime,  
Takin roads that lead me nowhere,  
How do I expect to get there,  
But when will I learn to just put you first.

I come to you now when I need you,  
But why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong cause only with you can I
move on. Can I move on.  
(Oh)  
When I awake it's you that makes  
Me strong,  
And I know that you've been with me all along,  
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart,  
With you life is so easy why do I  
Make it hard,  
Oh takin' roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first.  
(Hey!)

I come to you now when I need you,  
But why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong cause only with you can I
move on.  
I get out of my own way, let you have your way.  
Cause I realize I'm no god on my own,  
I'm there for you, I'll sell for you  
I can't live without you.  
Noooo...

I come to you now when I need you,  
Why do I wait to come see you,  
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong,  
I was wrong, I was wrong.  
With only you, only you,  
With only you.  
Can I move on,  
Can I move on,  
Can I move on.
