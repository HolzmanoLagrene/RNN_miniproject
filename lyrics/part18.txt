Regardless of the things in my past that I've done  
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun  
On the carousel so around I spun (spun)  
With no directions just tryna get some (some)  
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)  
An' so I lost more than I had ever won  
And honestly I ended up with none  
  
There's so much nonsense  
It's on my conscience  
I'm thinking baby I should get it out  
And I don't wanna sound redundant  
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know  
(That you wanna know)  
But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)

You tried to call but I didn't pick up  
See I forgot about our plans..  
Please forgive your man for ruining your night so many times  
I'm sorry, I know you're mad  
And I don't wanna be like every other man that you've had  
So I'm stopping all these childish things, girl, you mean too much to me  
Your love is worth too much to lose  
Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today  
I know that I'm the one to blame, you say every man's the same  
But watch how quick I change my ways.. Starting today, starting today  
Girl, I'm starting today..  
You're tired of playing the kiss and make up game  
And I apologize for the man I became

My neighbors think I'm crazy  
But they don't understand  
You're all I have  
You're all I have

At night when the stars  
Light up my room  
I sit by myself  
Talking to the moon  
Tryin' to get to you  
In hopes you're on  
The other side  
Talking to me too  
Or am I a fool  
Who sits alone  
Talking to the moon  
  
Oh  
  
I'm feeling like I'm famous  
The talk of the town  
They say I've gone mad  
Yeah I've gone mad  
But they don't know what I know  
  
'Cause when the sun goes down  
someone's talking back  
Yeah they're talking back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Ah, ah, ah)  
  
Do you ever hear me calling?  
(Ah) oh oh oh  
(Ah) oh oh oh  
'Cause every night  
I'm talking to the moon  
Still trying to get to you  
  
In hopes you're on  
The other side  
Talking to me too  
Or am I a fool  
Who sits alone  
Talking to the moon  
  
I know you're somewhere out there  
Somewhere far away

Turn the t.v. on  
Throw my hand in my pants  
Nobody's gon' tell me I cant, no  
  
I'll be loungin' on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie  
Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie

Bruno Mars,The Other Side,/b/bruno+mars/the+other+side_20457595.html,"Truth of the matter is I'm complicated  
You're as straight as they come  
You go 'bout your day baby  
While I hide from the sun  
  
It's better if you don't understand  
'Cause you won't know what it's like  
Until you try  
  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side  
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line  
I could wait a whole life time  
But you just gotta decide  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,  
Waiting on the other side  
  
We would live forever  
Who could ask for more  
You could die if you wanted  
But baby what for  
  
It's better if you don't understand  
And you won't know what it's like  
Until you try  
  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side  
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line  
I could wait a whole life time  
But you just gotta decide  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,  
Waiting on the other side  
  
If they say life's a dream  
Call this insomnia  
'Cause this ain't Wonderland  
It damn sure ain't Narnia  
And once you cross the line  
You can't change your mind  
Yeah I'm a monster  
But I'm no Frankenstein  
And quite frankly  
I've been feeling insane in between my eyes  
I really can't explain what I feel inside  
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide  
Many have tried to go into the night  
Cross over the line and come back alive  
But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side  
  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side  
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line  
I could wait a whole life time  
But you just gotta decide  
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,  
Waiting on the other side  
  
It's better if you don't understand  
It's better if you don't understand  
It's better if you don't understand  
It's better if you don't understand

If you let me treasure you  
If you let me treasure you  
  
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl you should be smiling  
A girl like you should never live so blue  
You're everything I see in my dreams  
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true  
  
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine  
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine  
  
Treasure, that is what you are  
Honey you're my golden star  
You know you can make my wish come true  
If you let me treasure you  
If you let me treasure you  
  
You are my treasure, you are my treasure

I, I, I don't know why why  
It seems like every other night you pick a fight, fight  
And I know I do the same, be callin' you out your name,  
This is not what lovers are supposed to do do  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
You tell me to go, I start walking out  
But we both know what we're all about  
We fuss, fight, and scream  
And it's all because of love  
But you and I both of we ain't ever giving up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everytime I try to leave  
Somethin's tells me turn around  
'Cause how could I ever leave  
The only one that holds me down  
'Cause I know we can work it out  
Talk it out, stick it out oohh  
Everytime I try to leave  
Find that we can figure it out  
That's why I always turn around  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Baby, before you say, say,  
Something you know you'll take back later on today, day.  
Sometimes you drive me crazy, but I love ya, baby  
All I ask is that you'll always appreciate me, ooohh...

It all just sounds like ooh, ooh ooh hoo hoo  
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize  
That I should have bought you flowers  
And held your hand  
Should have given you all my hours  
When I had the chance  
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance  
  
Now my baby's dancing  
But she's dancing with another man  
  
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways  
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life  
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh  
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

I'll be the first to say that I was wrong  
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late  
To try and apologize for my mistakes  
But I just want you to know  
  
I hope he buys you flowers  
I hope he holds your hand  
Give you all his hours  
When he has the chance  
Take you to every party

Do all the things I should have done  
When I was your man

On a billboard on a highway

A smile out of nowhere,  
Stops me in my tracks  
Can't believe that after all this time  
You still have that kind of impact  
  
Everywhere I turn I see your face  
Proving that a fool's love never fades  
In my mind your image is forever burned  
I keep trying not to stare but your always there  
Everywhere I turn  
  
In a steamed up cafe window  
I spell out your name  
I watch people run across the street  
Through the pouring rain  
There you are again so easy to find  
Under the umbrella in another woman's eyes  
  
Well I thought I'd suffered long enough for you babe  
And my mind would let go of the pain, any day  
But it don't work that way....

How lucky I am lucky I am  
To be the one who fills your eyes  
Blowin' away, sails on a lake  
Flyin' like a flag in the sky  
Bright colored balloons in the wind

And I'm drinking that sweet taste of rain

But when it's right, your love grows

Now that's a common little miracle I know.  
But for me and Becky Lynn she's the dream that started  
When we fell in love so many years ago

And I think I hear your mama calling  
Gotta go  
Oh man I loved you so

Bryan White,Tree Of Hearts,/b/bryan+white/tree+of+hearts_20025806.html,"On a tree inside a heart  
A dull boyscout knife  
Took half a day to carve  
Michael loves Caroline  
He just turned ten and she was nine  
  
The summer she turned sweet sixteen  
He finally found his nerve  
And took her out to see  
And what she saw through her tears  
Were seven hearts for seven years  
  
CHORUS:  
And they stood beneath the tree of hearts  
And they watch their feelings grow  
And they swore they'd never be apart  
True love left it's mark  
On the tree of hearts  
  
The tenth time he carved their names  
Caroline's dad was giving her away  
There beneath the shelter of  
The tree of hearts they pledged their love  
  
And then four hearts down the road  
They brought the first of two born home  
  
CHORUS:  
And they played beneath the tree of hearts  
And they watched their children grow  
And they swore they'd never be apart  
True love left it's mark  
On the tree of hearts  
  
BRIDGE:  
In the blinking of an eye  
Somehow fifty-seven hears flew by  
  
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine  
Sixty he missed Caroline  
At sixty-one Michael knew  
There wouldn't be a sixty-two  
  
CHORUS:  
Now they lay beneath the tree of hearts  
An you can watch their love still grow  
Where they swore they'd never be apart  
True love left it's mark  
On the tree of hearts.

It has a melody both happy and sad  
Built on victorious known triads

Though no-one in the hall is even watching  
They are transfixed, they are forgetting just to breathe  
They are so taken by your symphony in C  
  
You are sitting there thinking your thoughts  
They are not about what is but what is not

You'd lift this steaming herd  
You would kill all the sick ones  
You would bury them deep in the earth  
  
Without the tight little denim  
Your virtues would all go unknown  
Without the room that you live in  
Your cancers would eat to the bone  
  
Your muscles would bulge underground  
Your demons would all be around  
Without the pretty pink ribbon  
You'd end up just like me

And if another actress threatens  
My position on the throne  
  
Well, I don't know exactly what I'll do  
I don't exactly know  
But I know that it could turn into  
One of my most poignant roles  
Everyone will have their handkerchiefs out  
And they'll have to leave the theater early  
And then they'll go home  
And what'll they do?  
They'll have a big glass of alcohol  
  
'Cause I'm an actress through and through  
And to my bones  
And if I make it to the top I won't be overthrown  
I'm an actress ah, yeah, yeah

And some day I'll know that moment divine,

A case of do or die

He built his own boat and made his own cabin

there were secrets we shared we planted a tree  
We lived in a cabin, I fished along side of him  
I fell under the spell of his sorcery  
  
When he cast me adrift at the end of the summer  
It was not for another but his own privacy  
I fell apart like a rose, but the scent of my longing  
Remains and it weeps like an old willow tree  
  
At night when it's still, with a yellow moon rising  
When his candle is snuffed and he's deep in a dream  
I move like a cat, and crawl into his window  
And lie down beside him in a golden moonbeam  
  
The smell of his skin is just like the summer  
When our love was as fresh as the grass in the fields  
And ever so softly I kiss his eyelids  
Before slipping away, my secret concealed  
  
Though I'm in it alone, I'm still in it, In love  
And love can be lonely like a sweet melody  
But just maybe he feels like a whisper inside him  
Like an angel beside him, keeping him company

Did you silence me, remove me from your faith?  
  
Did you make me all but a stranger to your love?  
Did you look right through me  
Below me and above?  
Did you try to ignore me, make me all but lost?  
Did you cloud up the sky when you needed me most?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gonna be fine  
It's gonna be fine, just fine  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Hold out your heart  
And I will give you all of mine

Hold on to what you've got

Hold on to what you've got  
  
'Cause if you think  
Nobody else wants it  
Just throw it away  
And you will see  
Somebody else will have it  
Before you can count 1-2-3  
  
You take love for granted  
And it's gone like a bandit  
And this loneliness cuts like a knife  
  
When you see what you've lost  
It's already cost  
The one you could love your whole life

Somethings gone wrong  
You've stifled your cries  
You can't expect that I'll ever forget  
  
All the details of your mind you would tell me through the night  
After we'd made love and the way was so open  
Now you turn your back to me  
As if we'd never spoken

The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along the unbroken song  
Of peace on earth  
Peace on earth  
Peace on earth, good will to men  
  
And in despair I bowed my head  
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said  
""For hate is strong and mocks the song  
Of peace on earth  
Peace on earth  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
""God is not dead, nor doth he sleep  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
With peace on earth  
Peace on earth""

A blue eyed drummer rehearses outside  
A black spider dancing on top of his eye  
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike

Holding onto, talking, saying nothing  
Knowing in a moment I could lose you

Knowing when you came to me that no one else  
Would ever feel the same in my arms

Wakin' in the morning to the tenderness  
Of holding you asleep in my arms  
Dreaming while my hair was blowing  
Softer than a whisper on my cheek

Fevers of desire

Some I tore to shreds  
Lifetimes later, here they are  
Ones I saved instead

Mostly born of pain  
Resurfaced with the purpose of  
A trip down memory lane

All the way it went  
Evidence of what I saw  
My experiments

With the other girls

For what was wrong with us  
As the room is emptying out  
Your face so young comes into view  
And on the back porch is a well-worn step  
And a pool of light you can walk into

Do you know any more about God?  
Are you dancing with Benjamin Franklin  
On the face of the moon?  
Have you reconciled with Dad?  
Does the rain still make you sad?  
Last night I swear I could feel you  
Moving through my room  
And I thought you touched my feet  
I so wanted it to be true  
In my theater there is a stage  
And a footlight you can step into

Of what in my soul I know is true  
  
Come in my boat, there's a seat beside me  
And two or three stars we can gaze into  
  
I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,  
That part of our life together is over  
But I will wait for you forever  
Like a river  
  
I'll never leave, always just a dream away  
A star that's always watching  
Never turn away  
We'll never leave, always just a thought away  
A candle always burning  
Never turn away  
The moon will hide, the tree will bend  
I'm right beside you  
I'll never turn away

I used to feel  
I used to feel something for you  
But I've been sleep walking  
Stumbling in false starts, fumbling into false hearts  
Tumbling into false hearts, mainly mine  
  
Make me feel something  
Feel something  
Can it be I'm growing old  
Feel something  
Maybe I'm just too controlled  
Feel something  
I'm much too young to feel this old  
  
make me walk on air  
I used to dare  
I used to take chances for you  
But now I'm longing to feel passion  
'Cause I've only been pretending  
Acting out the drama  
Dying for a happy end  
Just to feel alive  
  
I don't want to say ""I love you""  
To one more fantasy  
You'd never believe  
What a good actress I could be  
  
Remember when  
We were fresh in love  
Your eyes were pale like the moon  
We'd sit on the porch in Summer  
Listen to the breezes  
Spinning melodies  
I dressed you up like a god  
The one you were

And I will love thee still, my dear

And it's there for all the world to see  
Just 'cause everybody does it  
That doesn't make it right for me  
Someone is making plans  
Involvin' my old man  
Everytime I turn by back around  
Feelin' like a one man woman  
Living in a two time town  
  
Now the place I come from  
People don't grow on trees  
And you can't treat people like meat  
Without getting brought to your knees  
Now and then  
The way I've been feeling  
Since I hit this town  
Like to jump in the river and drown  
Feeling like a one man woman  
Living in a two time town  
  
Sometimes I'd like  
To get out on the floor  
Shake it till dawn  
Some young thing  
Like to teach him the bump  
Make me want to take him home  
Well excuse me  
I don't mean to preach no lectures  
Yeah but me and my man won't  
Be able to stay for breakfast  
I guess he's got the itch  
And I'm just a bitch  
Who's trying to bring him down  
  
Feeling like a one man woman  
Acting like a one man woman  
I guess I'm just a one man woman

But it was there for us  
It was there for us

Was ready to be reborn  
And you called of the hounds  
Of hell with your songs

You could have held me again

Somewhere along the road  
You lost your faith  
Out of despair and believing

You gave up on us  
  
But it was there for us,  
It was there for us  
I loved you all along

Was after we'd shared hell and heaven  
And all the places in-between  
And all the places in-between  
  
After we'd spent nights together  
And breathed secrets without words  
After we'd made promises  
That could but might not have been heard  
Might not have been heard  
  
Knowing me the way you do  
Then why did you just say  
That our first day together  
Was today?

The we started our own newspaper  
Gave the truth about Uncle Sam  
We loved to be so radical  
But like a ragged love affair  
Some became disenchanted  
And some of us just got scared  
  
Now are you playing possum  
Keeping a low profile  
Are you playing possum for a while  
  
Then you moved to the country  
Bought a farm and tilled the land  
Then you took your books to India  
And got hooked on a holy man  
But the wells they do run dry  
And the speeches turn to words  
And the woods are full of tigers  
And freedom's for the birds  
  
Now you run a bookstore  
And you've taken on a wife  
You wear patches on your elbows  
And you live an easy life  
But are you finally satisfied  
Is it what you were lookin' for  
Or does it sneak up on you  
That there might be something more

And rollin' down the hills with me.

But when their hair gets long  
They think about winding it around in daisy chains  
Waitin' for the showers  
Just to wash it in the rain  
Have you seen such hair?  
Well let the wind play  
As you're rollin' down the hills with me

Write songs about plains  
But if that's not what you want to do  
Well you can jump aboard a bus  
Or boat or wooden canoe  
I know just the mountain  
That's been waitin' for you  
Too write songs about the peaks  
And the beautiful views  
As you're rollin' down the hills with me.

One gives the other a ride  
  
I've never had a best friend before  
So I can't be sure what it feels like  
But I think it feels more like this  
I think I feel more like myself

Losing and finding  
Making a bond that is strong  
Building a house for our friendship  
Breathing a breath for our song  
For our song
