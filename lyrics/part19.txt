Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze  
As seagulls fly I knew that I was losin'  
Love was washed away with the driftin' tide  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
And now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding  
The future that lies before me I cannot see  
(look at, look at, the future I cannot see)  
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising  
Lighting up the world for everyone, but not for me  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
(look at, look at, the future I cannot see)  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
(All you get from love is an old love song)  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
(Got to take the blame for an old love song)  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song

For the music to start

Carpenters,At The End Of A Song,/c/carpenters/at+the+end+of+a+song_20027628.html,"They tell me  
Somewhere this life isn't crazy  
But I've traveled the world far and wide  
And I say they're wrong  
  
Don't sell me  
Stories that music's a lady  
It's not when the singer's alone  
At the end of a song  
  
[Chorus]  
At the end of a song  
There's no one  
After the last note is played  
Only the memory stays  
Then even that fades away  
And there's nothing so hard  
As convincing your heart  
That you should start singing again  
  
You told me  
Nothing could change perfect lovers  
But like every promise you made  
It broke before long  
  
It's lonely  
Falling away from each other  
But we've come to the last of your words  
And the end of a song  
  
[Chorus]

Carpenters,Away In A Manger,/c/carpenters/away+in+a+manger_20516522.html,"Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,  
The little Lord Jesus, lays down his sweet head.  
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,  
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh.  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.  
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,  
And take us to heaven, to live with Thee there.

I just can't smile, without you  
  
  
Some people say the happiness wave  
  
Is somethin' that's hard to find  
  
Into the new leavin' the old behind me

I feel glad when you're glad  
  
And you must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you  
  
  
Into the new, leaving the old behind me

Waited through spring and fall  
To hear silver bells ringing  
See winter time bringing  
The happiest season of all  
  
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jackfrost nippin' at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Will help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes of a glow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is going to spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times,  
Many ways  
Merry Christmas to you

Carpenters,Crescent Noon,/c/carpenters/crescent+noon_20027499.html,"Green September  
  
Burned to October brown  
  
Bare November  
  
Led to December's frozen ground  
  
The seasons stumbled round  
  
Our drifting lives are bound  
  
To a falling crescent noon  
  
  
Feather clouds cry  
  
A vale of tears to earth  
  
Morning breaks and  
  
No one sees the quiet mountain birth  
  
Dressed in a brand new day  
  
The sun is on its way  
  
To a falling crescent noon  
  
  
Somewhere in  
  
A fairytale forest lies one  
  
Answer that is waiting to be heard  
  
  
  
You and I were  
  
Born like the breaking day  
  
All our seasons  
  
All our green Septembers  
  
Burn away  
  
Slowly we'll fade into  
  
A sea of midnight blue  
  
And a falling crescent noon

Carpenters,Deadman's Curve,/c/carpenters/deadmans+curve_20027541.html,"I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night  
When an XKE pulled up on my right.  
He rolled down the window of his shiny, new Jag  
And challenged me then and there to a drag.  
I said, ""You're on, Buddy, my mill's running fine  
Let's come of the line, now, at Sunset and Vine  
But I'll go ya one better, if you've got the nerve  
Let's race all the way ... to Deadman's Curve""  
  
CHORUS:  
Deadman's Curve--is no place to play  
Deadman's Curve--you best keep away  
Deadman's Curve--I can hear them say  
You won't come back from Deadman's Curve  
  
The street was deserted late Friday night,  
We were buggin' each other as we sat out the light  
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green  
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine  
I flew past La Brea, Schwabs, and Crescent Heights  
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights  
He passed me at Doheny and I started to swerve  
But I pulled it out and there we were: At Deadman's curve  
  
(SPOKEN) Well, the last thing I remember, Doc, I started to swerve  
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve  
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight  
I found out for myself that everyone was right:  
  
Won't come back from Deadman's Curve!

Carpenters,Goodbye To Love,/c/carpenters/goodbye+to+love_20027565.html,"I'll say goodbye to love  
No one ever cared if I should live or die  
Time and time again the chance for love  
Has passed me by  
And all I know of love  
Is how to live without it  
I just can't seem to find it.  
  
So I've made my mind up I must live  
My life alone  
And though it's not the easy way  
I guess I've always known  
I'd say goodbye to love.  
  
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine  
Surely time will lose these bitter memories  
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in  
And to live for something I could live for.  
  
All the years of useless search  
Have finally reached an end  
Loneliness and empty days will be my  
Only friend  
From this day love is forgotten  
I'll go on as best I can.  
  
What lies in the future  
Is a mystery to us all  
No one can predict the wheel of fortune  
As it falls  
There may come a time when I will see that  
I've been wrong  
But for now this is my song.  
  
And it's goodbye to love  
I'll say goodbye to love.

Carpenters,Goodnight,/c/carpenters/goodnight_20027781.html,"When I was young I'd listen to the radio  
Waitin' for my favorite songs  
When they played I'd sing along  
It made me smile  
Those were such happy times and not so long ago  
How I wondered where they'd gone  
But they're back again just like a long lost friend  
All the songs I loved so well  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling  
That they're startin' to sing's so fine  
When they get to the part  
Where he's breakin' her heart  
It can really make me cry just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by  
And the good times that I had  
Makes today seem rather sad  
So much has changed  
It was songs of love that I would sing to then  
And I'd memorize each word  
Those old melodies still sound so good to me  
As they melt the years away  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling  
That they're startin' to sing's so fine  
All my best memories  
Come back clearly to me  
Some can even make me cry just like before  
It's yesterday once more

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away  
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone  
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear  
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear  
When I'd start to play folks used to say  
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""  
  
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony  
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""  
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools  
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""  
  
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long  
The leader said that I played all the music wrong  
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own  
Got together a new kind of orchestree  
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony  
And I must admit we made a hit

A child arrived just the other day  
He came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
And he was talking before I knew it and as he grew  
He said, ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm gonna be like you""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Dad, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then,  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
My son turned ten just the other day  
He said ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on lets play  
Can you teach me to throw? "" I said, ""Not today,  
I got a lot to do"" He said ""that's okay""  
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed  
And said ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah  
You know I'm going to be like him""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Dad, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then,  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
Well he came from college just the other day  
So much like a man I just had to say,  
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""  
He shook his head, and he said with a smile  
  
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See you later, can I have them please? ""  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon  
When you comin home, Son, I don't know when,  
But we'll get together then, Dad  
You know we'll have a good time then.  
  
I've long since retired, my son's moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
I said ""Id like to see you if you don't mind""  
He said ""Id love to Dad, if I could find the time.  
You see my new jobs a hassle, and the kids have the flu.  
But It's sure nice talking to you, Dad,  
It's been sure nice talking to you........ ""  
And as I hung up the phone it had occurred to me  
He'd grown up just like me,  
My boy was just like me..............  
  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man in the moon

Yourself, oh no no no.

How can I try to explain?  
When I do he turns away again  
It's always been the same, same old story  
From the moment I could talk  
I was ordered to listen  
Now there's a way  
And I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go  
  
It's not time to make a change  
Just sit down, take it slowly  
You're still young, that's your fault  
There's so much you have to go through  
Find a girl, settle down  
If you want you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
All the times that I've cried  
Keeping all the things I knew inside  
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it  
If they were right I'd agree  
But it's them they know, not me  
Now there's a way  
And I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go

Mine is the morning,  
Born of the one light Eden saw play.  
Praise with elation, praise ev'ry morning,  
God's recreation of the new day.  
  
Morning has broken...

Cat Stevens,New York Times,/c/cat+stevens/new+york+times_20028078.html,"New York poor New York  
New York poor New York  
  
Cars choking your child to death  
But you don't want to see  
Cause you only think about yourself  
How blind can you be  
  
New York poor New York  
Sniper on the rooftop New York  
New York poor New York  
Not fit for a dog in New York  
  
Everybody bites on the Big Apple  
Leave the hungry in tears  
But no one gives a damn no one really cares  
How they feel they're just paper people not real  
  
You need a gun to walk into New York  
  
Now you're broke and you're out on a ledge  
Who can help you this time  
Now you're down to your very last cent  
Still you're askin' me who was your friend  
I was your friend  
  
New York poor New York  
Who turned the lights out in New York  
  
New York poor New York  
Just another blackout in New York  
  
Girl dead on the 26th floor  
But no one knew her name  
Found her body behind the door  
Too young for the game  
  
New York poor New York  
Devils in the subway New York  
New York poor New York  
New York poor New York  
Talkin' talkin' talkin', watch out  
Harlem touching midtown New York  
New York poor New York  
  
Talkin' 'bout New York New York  
Money's getting tighter New York  
They're burning the bridges to New York

Stones crumbling under my feet I see smoke for miles around  
Oh it's enough to make you weep, all that remains of the main street  
Up in the park on Sunday, dogs chasing and the children played  
Old man with his head down, can't see nothing more around, no  
  
But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days,  
So nice to see you coming back in this town again  
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through having tea  
In the afternoon, so nice to see you coming back in this town again  
  
Ah but it's all changed winter turned on a man  
Came down on day when no-one was looking and it  
Stole away the land, people running scared, losing hands  
Dodging shadows of falling sand, buildings standing like empty shells  
And nobody...helping no-one else  
Young child with his hands high, ain't able to see no reason why, no  
  
But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days,  
So nice to see you coming back in this town again  
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through  
You'd better know what you're going through now  
You came back here to find your home is a black horizon  
  
That you don't recognize, evil destruction has taken everything  
You'd better walk on the side while you're still walking  
Just keep on walking on down the street keep your distance  
From the people you meet.  
  
Oh Lord and you'd better watch your eyes  
'Cause if smoke gets in them, baby you won't rise again.  
Where's it leading to freedom at what cost  
People needing more and more and it's all getting lost  
I want back, I want back  
Back to the time when the earth was green  
And there was no high walls and the sea was clean  
Don't stop that sun to shine, it's not yours or mine, no.

Bleeding half my soul in bad company,

Only for that light I see  
Cause when I'm dead and lowered low in my grave,  
That's gonna be the only thing that's left of me

Two eyes like lights, milky marble whites looking up at me  
Looking for a way, Moons in an endless day  
  
All I knew was with her then, no couldn't see the time  
As we drank down the wine to the last Sweet Scarlet  
How was I to wonder why or even question this  
Underneath her her kiss I was so unguarded  
Every bottle's empty now and all those dreams are gone  
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy  
  
She was so much younger then, wild like the wind  
A gypsy with a grin from and old far away country  
but deep beneath her curls,  
Beneath this misty pearl, there was more to see  
  
She could move mountains in the dark as silent as a knife  
She cut loose a life that she never no never really wanted  
All those days are frozen now and all those scars are gone  
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy  
  
Come let us drink again, before the second show  
I want you so to know there's no bridge between us  
All those gates have opened now, and through the light has shone  
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy

It is you who I wish to share my body with she said  
We'll find a dry place under the sky with a flower for a bed  
And for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and star on his head.  
Her silver hair flowed in the air laying waves across the sun  
Her hands were like the white sands, and her eyes had diamonds on.  
We left the road and headed up to the top of the Whisper Wood  
And we walked 'till we came to where the holy magnolia stood.  
And there we laid cool in the shade singing songs and making love  
  
With the naked earth beneath us and the universe above.  
The time was late my wedding wouldn't wait I was sad but I had to go,  
So while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for cheerio.  
  
The wedding took place and people came from many miles around  
There was plenty merriment, cider and wine abound  
But out of all that I recall I remembered the girl I met  
'Cause she had given me something that my hear could not forget.  
A year had passed and everything was just as it was a year before  
As if was a year before  
  
Until the gift that someone left, a basket by my door.  
And in there lay the fairest little baby crying to be fed,  
I got down on my knees and kissed the moon and star on his head.  
  
As years went by the boy grew high and the village looked on in awe  
They'd never seen anything like the boy with the moon and star before.  
And people would ride from far and wide just to seek the word he spread  
I'll tell you everything I've learned, and Love is all, he said.

Cat Stevens,The Hurt,/c/cat+stevens/the+hurt_20028108.html,"You say you want to seek the truth, but it's hard to find  
No one to help you, your friends don't have the time  
So you ride around in your car, switch on the radio  
You want to relate to something you once read in a book  
What kind of a way to try to take a look  
  
Until I got hurt I was looking, I was on my way  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I painted my face grey  
Until I got hurt, 'til I got hurt, why didn't I  
I didn't think of this until I got hurt  
'Till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is  
  
You say you want to learn to laugh 'cause music makes you cry  
But the tears you shed are only in your eye  
So you turn to any phony mouth with a tale to tell  
But he's just a hoaxer don't you know, selling peace and religion  
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum  
  
Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was the same as you  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, I did not know what to do  
Until I got hurt, 'till I got hurt, why didn't [

Young son, don't let me down, young son  
I'm trusting you to keep on, never turn away now  
Hold on, never let go, now hold on  
Turn your heart to the bright sun  
Love will come your way  
Cause 'till you make that final show  
You'll never know what love you've been missing  
Missing  
  
You say you want to seek the truth but you work alone  
No one to help you and nobody to push you on  
So you sit at home drinking your wine, television on  
You wait for a miracle, 'cause you say one day one'll come along  
( But wishful thinking, boy) any minute now ! You might be gone  
I'd like to help you brother but that would be wrong  
  
Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was on my way  
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I didn't know which way  
Until I got hurt, 'till I got hurt, why didn't I

Once in a summertime garden lived a little apple tree  
And the man who owned it wanted it to be picked  
So he sent forth to hire me  
  
Well, I've traveled the mountains, and I've traveled the sea  
But a never in my traveling days  
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me!  
  
Laugh, oh laugh a little apple  
Autumn is waitin', you'd better be careful,  
For it will bring you down  
If it ever sees you wearing a frown  
  
So laugh, laugh a little apple  
Well all the apples were hidin'  
Frightened that they might be plucked  
And everytime that somebody passed  
All except that one little apple ducked  
  
Well, I've traveled the mountains, and I've traveled the sea  
But a never in my traveling days  
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me!  
  
Laugh, oh laugh a little apple

For it will bring you down

There's no frame of reference for the way I feel  
Would you look at your face  
I'm still amazed, I can't believe you're real  
I can lie here forever just watching you sleep  
Hanging on every breath that you breathe  
  
Your touch wraps around

Celine Dion,At Seventeen,/c/celine+dion/at+seventeen_21068351.html,"I learned the truth at seventeen  
That love was meant for beauty queens  
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles  
Who married young and then retired  
  
The valentines I never knew  
The Friday night charades of youth  
Were spent on one more beautiful  
At seventeen I learned the truth  
  
And those of us with ravaged faces  
Lacking in the social graces  
Desperately remained at home  
Inventing lovers on the phone  
Who called to say ""Come dance with me""  
And murmured vague obscenities  
It isn't all it seems at seventeen  
  
A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs  
Whose name I never could pronounce  
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve  
They only get what they deserve.  
The rich relationed hometown queen  
Marries into what she needs  
With a guarantee of company  
And haven for the elderly""  
  
So remember those who win the game  
Lose the love they sought to gain  
In debentures of quality  
And dubious integrity  
The small town eyes will gape at you  
In dull surprise when payment due  
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen  
  
To those of us who knew the pain  
Of valentines that never came  
And those whose names were never called  
When choosing sides for basketball  
It was long ago and far away  
The world was younger than today  
When dreams were all they gave for free  
To ugly ducking girls like me  
  
We all play the game and when we dare  
We cheat ourselves at solitaire  
Inventing lovers on the phone  
Repenting other lives unknown  
That call and say, ""Come dance with me""  
And murmur vague obscenities  
At ugly girls like me at seventeen

Celine Dion,Ave Maria,/c/celine+dion/ave+maria_20028692.html,"Ave Maria, Maiden mild  
Oh, listen to a maiden's prayer  
For thou canst hear amid the wild  
'Tis thou, 'tis thou canst save amid, despair  
  
We slumber safely till the morrow  
Though we've by man outcast reviled  
Oh Maiden, see a maiden's sorrow  
Oh Mother, hear a suppliant child  
  
Ave Maria  
  
Ave Maria gratia plena  
Maria gratia plena  
Maria gratia plena  
Ave ave dominus, dominus tecum  
  
The murky cavern's air so heavy  
Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled  
Oh Maiden, hear a maiden pleadin'  
Oh Mother, hear a suppliant child

Et c'est l'autre que je pr? F? Re  
Il n'a rien dit mais il me pla? T

Battit de l'aile et s'envola

To the shepherd boy

Ringing through the night

Do you hear what I hear  
A song, a song  
High above the trees  
With a voice  
As big as the sea  
With a voice  
As big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy  
To the mighty king  
Do you know what I know  
In your palace warm  
Mighty king  
Do you know what I know  
A child  
A child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him  
Silver and gold  
Let us bring him  
Silver and gold  
  
Said the king  
To the people everywhere  
Listen to what I say  
Pray for peace

He will bring us  
Goodness and light  
He will bring us

Visions of you  
But I can't get through the night  
  
So pick up the phone  
I know you're home  
You're playin' with my heart  
And you know that it just ain't right  
  
It's just a game of love, love, love  
And even though it's hard baby  
I can never give you up  
  
You're the one I'm dreamin' of  
I can't live without your love  
Tonight  
And it's you that I adore  
You're the one that I live for  
Inside  
Of you, I'm dreamin' of you  
  
So I get in the car  
But I didn't get far  
'Cause the radio played  
Every song that I sang with you  
  
Yesterday's gone  
And it may be true  
But you know that  
I'll never get over you  
  
It's just a game of love, love love  
And even though it hurts me baby  
I can never give you up  
  
'Cause you're the one I'm dreamin' of  
I can't live without your love  
Tonight  
And it's you that I adore  
You're the one that I live for  
Inside  
Of you, I'm dreamin' of you  
  
You, you gave me love  
Love gave us hope and strength  
To carry on and  
You, you gave me faith  
When I was fallin' down  
You would pick me up, my love  
  
You're the one I'm dreamin' of  
I can't live without your love  
Tonight  
And it's you that I adore  
You're the one that I live for

That boy is gonna hurt you  
His kind of love is not for real  
He's only playin'  
Foolin' with your heart girl  
But I know how he makes me feel  
And I don't need any other proof  
They just don't understand  
They don't know the truth  
Momma says he's bad for me  
Poppa says I'll be sorry  
Everybody's talkin' my baby down  
And all my friends doubt him  
Tell me I should live without him  
Everybody's talkin' my baby down  
  
He's not like the others  
Nobody wants to see it  
They don't even want to try  
  
Judge a book by its cover  
And you'll never know the story  
There's so much more than meets the eye  
Oh and I know his heart is true  
I don't need anyone  
To tell me what to do

My sisters and my brothers  
Tell me I should find another  
Everybody's talkin' my baby down  
  
Oh but they can't feel his touch  
They can't feel his kiss  
They don't know what it's like to be  
Loved like this  
I don't care about their point of view  
'Cause it's understood  
When the love is good  
Nothin' else is gonna do

No they don't know what he's all about  
Everybody just want to talk my baby down  
No they cant' see that his heart is gold  
Everybody want to treat my baby so cold,  
So cold

You don't think of the devil who's inside  
And maybe it'll come one day  
When you'll feel safe and I won't have the time  
  
You hear what you wanna hear  
Play it once I could disappear  
Some rules to the game of me  
Get it right for both of us  
  
Just say what you wanna say  
I've got it to give away  
We both wanna make it last  
So keep your eyes on me  
Your eyes on me  
  
It's not an illusion  
That you're the one  
And I have fallen deep  
I said it from the start  
When we're apart  
You must only think of me  
  
Temptation is all around  
Take good care of what you found  
That's why when I turn around  
You better keep  
You better keep your eyes on me  
No matter what you think I need  
No matter what you once believed  
If you're mine  
  
So you better say  
  
No matter what you think of me  
No it doesn't really matter what you once believed  
I wanna be the air you breathe  
Yeah you better be everything you said you'd be  
  
I'm gonna be your only one  
  
We really can't go on  
No matter what you think of me  
You better keep your eyes on me  
  
And say that you want me  
Open up your heart  
Even if it's hard  
Say that you need me  
Then let him know  
Baby don't put on a show  
  
You say that you need me  
Tell him how you feel  
Let him know it's real  
And if you love me  
Never turn your back  
Gonna keep my eyes on him  
  
Temptation is all around  
Take good care of what you found  
That's why when I turn around  
You better keep  
You better keep your eyes on me

I see us inside of each other  
I feel my unconscious merge with yours  
And I hear a voice say, What's his is hers  
  
I'm falling into you  
This dream could come true  
And it feels so good falling into you  
  
I was afraid to let you in here  
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear  
The walls begin to tumble down  
And I can't even see the ground  
  
I'm falling into you  
This dream could come true  
And it feels so good falling into you  
  
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star  
Finding a belief, falling where you are  
  
Catch me, don't let me drop!  
Love me, don't ever stop!  
  
So close your eyes and let me kiss you  
And while you sleep I will miss you  
  
I'm falling into you  
This dream could come true  
And it feels so good falling into you

You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Everybody's got the fever  
That is something you all know  
Fever isn't such a new thing  
Fever started long ago, that's right  
  
Romeo loved Juliet  
Juliet she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her  
He said, ""Julie, baby, you're my flame""  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said, ""Oh Daddy, don't you dare""  
  
He gives me fever when he kisses me  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Fever, I'm his misses  
""Oh daddy, won't you treat him right""  
  
Now you've listened to my story  
Here's the point that I have made  
Cats were born to give chicks fever  
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade  
  
They give you fever when you kiss them  
Fever if you live and learn  
Fever 'til you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn

Leave this lonely world of ours  
Escape the sorrow and the pain  
And fly again  
  
Fly, fly precious one  
Your endless journey has begun  
Take your gentle happiness  
Far too beautiful for this  
Cross over to the other shore  
There is peace forevermore  
But hold this memory bittersweet  
Until we meet  
  
Fly, fly do not fear  
Don't waste a breath, don't shed a tear  
Your heart is pure, your soul is free  
Be on your way, don't wait for me  
Above the universe you'll climb  
On beyond the hands of time  
The moon will rise, the sun will set  
But I won't forget  
  
Fly, fly little wing  
Fly where only angels sing  
Fly away, the time is right  
Go now, find the light

And never let you go  
  
Baby, just have a heart  
I'm begging you  
Let me show you  
How much I need you  
  
Baby, just have a heart  
This much is true  
I miss your touch  
I'm still in love with you  
  
Here comes another day  
I don't know if I can make it  
Oh, I've just realized  
Its so lonely being free  
  
Runnin' from the pain  
I'm never gonna shake it  
Oh how I need you  
To take it from me, baby  
  
Baby just have a heart  
I'm beggin' you  
Let me show you  
How much I need you  
  
Baby just have a heart  
This much is true  
I miss your touch  
I'm still in love with you  
  
I always thought that I would have the  
Upper hand, but now I know that I'm  
Really not that strong  
If I could only make you understand  
I'd give you the world  
But for a start  
  
Baby just have a heart

Celine Dion,"Here, There And Everywhere",/c/celine+dion/here+there+everywhere_20219336.html,"To lead a better life  
I need my love to be here...  
  
Here, making each day of the year  
Changing my life with the wave of his hand  
Nobody can  
Deny that there's somethin' there  
  
There, running my hands through his hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be  
Someone is speaking but he doesn't know she's there  
  
[Chorus]  
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me  
I know I need never care  
But to love him is to need him everywhere  
Knowing that love is to share  
  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there  
I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there  
  
I will be there... and everywhere  
Here, there and everywhere

Can't stand in my way I'd go on  
Brutal machines unbending laws  
Can't slow me down I'd go on  
I've learned how to deal and when to fight  
I know what's real I know what's right  
I'm not afraid a wounded dove  
I can be tender in a world so tough  
  
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold  
But life without you I don't know  
  
The winds of the heart can blow me down  
But I get right up and I stand my ground  
I've tasted fear, my share of pain  
The wasted tears of love in vain  
I've held you tight, pushed you away  
Now with all my might I beg you to stay  
  
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold  
But life without you, I don't know  
  
I know what I want, I know what I need  
But there's just one thing I must believe  
Deep in the night by a dying flame  
You will be there when I call your name  
  
I'm sure I could face the bitter cold  
But life without you, I don't know

An evening star, watched from afar  
It guided me here, It knew you'd be here  
  
Now wrapped in moonlight, at last together  
Here in the incandescent glow, we are all we need to know  
As we softly please each other 'til the stars and shadows glow  
And we sing with our dreams among us  
  
Ahhhhhhhh  
Ohhhhahhhhhhhh  
It guided me here, It knew you'd be here  
  
I knew I loved you, before I found you  
And you had built my world around you  
Now all my days, they're now my nights  
And my tomorrows will all begin and end..... with you

Are so far away and oh

And you will catch me always

Too high for me to climb  
No ocean so wide

Cause you live and breather in me  
And nothing can come between  
We are one star  
No nigh can darken, Oh

Twentyfourth of December  
It was a cold and snowing night  
I still can remember Gazing at the stars and the moonlight  
Fell asleep on a sofabed  
Dreams of Christmas in my head

Chapel bells are gonna ring in me  
I met an angel on Christmas day  
I was stuffing the stockings  
And hanging tincel on the tree  
When I heard him knocking  
I opened the door in time to see  
Carollers sing ""Silver Bells""  
I saw his face, that's when I fell  
He was there bent on one knee  
Santa sent him just for me  
Listen up to what I got to say  
I found true love and it's here to stay  
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me  
I met an angel on a Christmas day

I'll wear his ring

Come on, ohhhh  
These walls keep a secret  
That only we know  
But how long can they keep it  
Cause we're two lovers who lose control  
We're two shadows chasing rainbows  
Behind closed windows  
Behind closed doors  
  
If walls could talk-oh  
They would say ""I want you more""  
They would say ""Hey, never felt like  
This before""  
And that you would always be the one for me  
Just two people making memories  
Too good to tell  
And these arms are never empty  
When we're lying where we fall  
We're painting pictures, making magic  
Taking chances,  
Making love  
  
If walls could talk-oh  
They would say ""I want you more""  
They would say ""Hey, never felt like  
This before""  
And that you would always be the one for me  
  
If walls had eyes, my  
They would see the love inside  
They would see me  
In your arms in ecstasy  
And with every move they'd know  
I love you so  
  
When I'm feeling weak  
YOu give me wings  
When the fire has no heat  
You light it up again  
When I hear no violins  
You play my every string  
  
So stop the press  
Hold the news  
The secret's safe between me and you  
Walls, can you keep a secret?  
  
If calls could talk, oh  
They would say ""I want you more""  
They would say ""Hey, never felt like  
This before""  
And that you would always be  
The one for me  
  
If walls had eyes, my  
They would see the love inside  
They would see, me  
In your arms in ecstasy  
And with every move they'd know  
I love you so

I feel that I'm alive  
  
When you look at me  
I can touch the sky  
I know that I'm alive  
  
When you bless the day  
I just drift away  
All my worries die  
I'm glad that I'm alive  
  
You've set my heart on fire  
Filled me with love  
Made me a woman on clouds above  
  
I couldn't get much higher  
My spirit takes flight  
Cause I'm alive  
  
(When you call on me)  
When you call on me

When I hear you breath  
I get wings to fly  
I feel that I'm alive  
I am alive  
  
(When you reach for me)  
When you reach for me  
Raising spirits high  
God knows that  
  
That I'll be the one  
Standing by  
  
Through good and through trying times  
  
And it's only begun  
I can't wait for the rest of my life

Celine Dion,Immortality,/c/celine+dion/immortality_20028553.html,"So this is who I am  
And this is all I know  
And I must choose to live  
For all that I can give  
The spark that makes the power grow  
  
And I will stand for my dream if I can  
Symbol of my faith in who I am  
But you are my only  
And I must follow on the road, that lies ahead  
And I won't let my heart control my head  
But you are my only  
And we don't say goodbye  
We don't say goodbye  
And I know what I've got to be  
  
Immortality  
I make my journey through eternity  
I keep the memory of you and me  
Inside  
  
Fulfill your destiny  
Is there within the child  
My storm will never end  
My fate is on the wind  
The king of hearts, the joker's wild  
We don't say goodbye  
We don't say goodbye  
I'll make them all remember me  
  
'Cause I have found a dream that must come true  
Every ounce of me must see it through  
But you are my only  
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play  
Hand over my heart I'll find my way  
I will make them give to me  
  
Immortality  
There is a vision and a fire in me  
I keep the memory of you and me, inside  
And we don't say goodbye  
We don't say goodbye  
  
With all my love for you  
And what else we may do  
We don't say, goodbye

Don't know where to start  
I guess we've come to  
The serious part  
I need to find out  
If there's a chance  
For us?

It won't win me over  
Don't give me that same old speech  
You don't have to speak at all  
  
You can say you love me  
That I'm your perfect crush  
How it hurts to need someone that much  
You can swear you mean it  
But that ain't good enough  
'cause when a man loves a woman it is all  
In his touch  
  
I wish you could you see (yeah)  
Just how simple  
It's supposed to be  
  
Cause now that we've come this far  
We don't want to loose it  
If you want to win my heart  
Baby just shut your mouth  
  
You can say you love me  
That I'm your perfect crush  
How it hurts to need someone that much  
You can swear you mean it

Celine Dion,In Some Small Way,/c/celine+dion/in+some+small+way_20422423.html,"there's a tree  
standing there  
in such an ordinary way  
but as I look around  
everything keeps changing  
there's a leaf  
on that tree  
and it floats into a stream  
and like everything  
it gets carried away  
to the sea...  
(chorus)  
but if we give a little of our love away  
maybe meet in the middle  
every night and day  
if we could hear just a whisper  
of what the heart needs to say  
it could sure make a difference  
in some small...  
in some small way  
in your heart lies the key  
that unlocks your destiny  
look within and we'll find  
everything we're longing for  
(chorus)  
oh...  
may you cherish each moment you live  
and know all the love that you give  
will go on and on and on...  
there's a sky vast and blue  
and it lies deep inside of you  
breathe it in  
let it out  
breathe it in again...

This old piano is still good  
Following me in my dreams  
Is not an easy task  
Sur les touches noires

Ou bien je gare  
Mes problemes

Or I park  
My problems

So this piano  
Don't know where it's going  
It cries or it laughes  
Or both at the same time  
It makes tremolos  
It's exact it's false  
Il melange tout  
Le pire et le meilleur  
Il colle bout a bout  
Mineur et puis majeur  
Il cogne un peu trop fort  
Et se trompe d'accord  
  
It mixes up everything  
The best and the worst  
It glues end to end  
Minor and then major  
It hits a bit too hard  
And doesn't do the right pitch

Je joue pianissimo  
En revant d'un inconnu  
Qui pour la vie entiere  
Me fera faire  
Un pas de plus

I play piannissimo  
Dreaming of a stranger  
Who for a lifetime  
Will make me make  
One more step  
Je n'ai que deux mains  
Mais l'air que j'aime bien  
Ne se joue qu'a quatre mains  
Mais pourvu qu'il existe  
Le pianiste  
Que j'attends  
  
I only have two hands  
But the music I like much  
Only plays with four hands  
But so long as exist

En attendant qu'il vienne  
Cet air que je compose  
Ne risque pas de faire  
Trembler (La vie en rose)  
Et pourtant je suis fiere  
D'avoir fait sur son nom  
Cette drole de chanson  
  
Waiting for him to arrive  
This music I create  
Don't have a chance to  
Make shiver (La vie en rose)  
But I'm proud  
To have done on its name  
This strange song  
Drole de chanson  
Cette drole de chanson  
  
Strange song  
This strange song

The world caved in on you again  
But I know what to do to ease the pain  
And bring you back to life again

Something's catching fire here  
And when the morning comes you'll be good as new  
You'll take this night that we've shared with you
