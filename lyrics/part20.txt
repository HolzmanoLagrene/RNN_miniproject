That I'm the only one you need

Give me lovin' proof  
I need lovin' proof from you, ooh baby  
  
And if the love you got is strong and true  
And if you love me like you say you do  
Your tender touch will tell the honest truth  
And your kiss can never tell a lie  
'Cause I'd see it in your eyes  
There's one way to ease any doubt  
I tell you now  
  
If you want me to believe  
That I'm the only one you need

And save these questions for another day

I think you know what I've been trying to say  
I promised I would never leave you  
Then you should always know  
Wherever you may go, no matter where you are  
I never will be far away  
  
Goodnight, my angel, now it's time to sleep  
And still so many things I want to say  
Remember all the songs you sang for me  
When we went sailing on an emerald bay  
And like a boat out on the ocean  
I'm rocking you to sleep  
The water's dark and deep, inside this ancient heart  
You'll always be a part of me  
  
Goodnight, my angel, now it's time to dream  
And dream how wonderful your life will be  
Someday your child may cry, and if you sing this lullaby  
Then in your heart there will always be a part of me  
Someday we'll all be gone  
But lullabys go on and on  
They never die  
That's how you and I will be

I'm not afraid to walk that line  
Just be natural and we can try  
Every little thing's gonna turn out fine... cause

Throw my heart away each spring  
Now a spring romance  
Hasn't got a chance  
Promised my first dance to winter  
All I've got to show's a splinter  
For my little fling  
  
Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse  
That never left the post  
I lay in my room  
Starring up at the ceiling  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
Morning kiss wakes trees and flower  
And to them my life  
To drink a toast I walk in the park  
Just to kill those lonely hours  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
All afternoon  
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune  
This is love this is it  
Heard it before  
And I know the score  
And I decide that love is a bore  
Love seem sure around the new year  
Now it's April  
  
Love is just a ghost  
Spring arrived on time  
But what became of you, dear  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
Spring is here  
There's no mistaken  
Robins build their nest from coast to coast  
My heart tries the same  
So they won't hear it breaking  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
College boys are riding somewhere  
Tender passion there it grows  
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
Love came my way  
I'm holding the last  
We had our day  
Now that's all in the past  
Spring came along  
A season of song  
For love's sweet promise  
But something went wrong  
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic  
Sulfur and molasses was the dose  
Didn't help me a bit  
My condition must be chronic  
Spring can really hang you up the most  
  
All alone, the party's over  
Winter was a gracious host  
But when you keep praying  
For snow to hide the clover  
Spring can really hang you up the most

Do they know, do they care, that it's only that I'm lonely  
And low as can be?  
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all!  
  
So I smoke a little too much and I drink a little too much

So I go at a maddening pace,  
And I pretend that it's taking your place

[Chorus]  
  
I never meant a single thing when you tried it  
You know it, I felt it, I liked it, I did it  
I never meant to put it there but somewhere In despair  
It got moved into view, then I liked it  
I never meant a single word when I said I could love you  
I thought it, I heard it, I used it  
I never meant a single beat of my heart to be yours  
Cause I knew, if you knew, you'd abuse it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a special time for lovin' and another time  
For huggin and a lot of time to leave him alone.

Chaka Khan,The Other Side Of The World,/c/chaka+khan/the+other+side+of+the+world_20028845.html,"I had known you for quite some time  
But the thought of love never crossed my mind  
It seemed to be on the other side of the world  
  
Too many times had I loved  
And not cared at all about ""love""  
Just to have something to do  
Then I saw a different you  
""And oh my!""  
  
There's so many stories of love  
All with the wonders of love  
And so very sad I would be  
'Cause none belonged to me  
  
Could be it's all for the best  
So I finally let it rest  
Sad but I felt that maybe  
Love wasn't meant for me  
  
So crazy how things can change your life  
Now that love is you, everything is right  
And loneliness is the other side of the world

I never knew which way to go  
Everybody had an answer  
So I said  
Go lecture someone, go lecture someone  
  
I could feel it in my heart babe  
I couldn't scream, I couldn't shout  
I had to find out in my own way  
Ran into someone - ran into someone  
  
I'll be the woman I am  
Now I don't have to hide  
All that I feel inside  
I'll be the woman I am  
Just had to let it show  
Had nowhere else to go  
  
I had to learn to trust myself  
I had to learn just when to say no  
Always trying to please someone else  
I had to let go, I had to let go  
  
The world is filled of many wonders  
I had to look to heaven for my own  
I saw the star that I was unter  
Lord lead me back home, lead me back home  
  
I'll be the woman I am  
Now I don't have to hide  
All that I feel inside  
I'll be the woman I am  
Just had to let it show  
Had nowhere else to go  
  
I can look at myself and I'm not afraid  
I have finally learned how to love  
I can feel everything that I've never felt  
And I'm sure now that I've always known

Come to think of it, don't know where to start  
I'd take it from the top but we don't have that much time  
So I'm breakin' off a piece of this crazy life of mine  
As a little girl, I had a stubborn mind  
Bonnie and me were wild most of the time  
I used to sing for mama's company  
I guess that was the start of the woman I came to be  
Sometimes young, yet so old  
Warm to the touch, intellectually cold  
I love the how and why of it  
Thank God, the pieces seem to fit  
Pieces seem to fit in this crazy life of mine  
Never will forget from whence I came  
I have some regrets but I made myself a name  
Two times a mother and as many times wed  
Tough times were around me but better times ahead  
If your heart can handle these words I've said  
I see you and me in this crazy life of mine  
Mine  
Gotcha

For closing books, and long last looks must end  
And as I leave  
I know that I am leaving my best friend  
A friend who taught me right from wrong  
And weak from strong  
That's a lot to learn  
What, what can I give you in return?  
  
If you wanted the moon  
I would try to make a start  
But i, would rather let me give my heart

Of telling tales and biting nails are gone, yeah  
But in my mind  
I know that they live on and on and on and on  
But how do you thank someone  
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?  
Well it's not easy  
But I'll try  
  
If you wanted the sky  
I would write across the sky in letters  
That would soar a thousand feet high  
To you, with love  
Those awkward years have hurried by  
Why did they fly, fly away  
Why is it sir children, grow up to be people one day?  
What takes the place of climbing tres and dirty knees in the world outside?  
What, what is there that I can buy?  
  
If you wanted the world  
I'd surround it with a wall I'd scrawl  
These words withe letters ten feet tall  
To you, with love

I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister  
  
Something's flowing through my veins  
What it is I don't know  
It's a three alarm fire in my heart  
Hope it doesn't show  
Call the doctor, call the judge  
Justice of the peace  
Pluck this flower in full bloom  
This relative's no niece  
Alright now, little sister  
Wait all night for the call  
  
She's alright with me  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister  
  
I'm at the crossroads waiting for a call  
Back against the wall again  
But I'm not just expecting anyone  
When I get the call that says it all  
She says yeah (robin, I'll be right over)  
  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister  
  
Oh, I like it when you talk dirty to me  
  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister
