You're more than lucky if you get out alive

It's hard to survive on a Saturday night

Seems to be all my life it's really gone to hell

Just took her youth and happiness  
As with the boy she vanished in  
The secret sweetness of their sin  
  
Oh, young girl  
Oh, young girl of sixteen  
Child of spring-time  
Still green  
Lying there by the road  
  
He told her, ""love demanded space""  
So they roamed from place to place  
Although she realized she'd sinned  
She grew caution to the wind  
As she followed him around  
While he slowly dragged her down  
  
So overpowering was her love  
The it had made a captive of  
The young girl's heart and soul and mind  
In other words: love drove her blind  
  
Oh, young girl  
Oh, young girl of sixteen  
Child of spring-time  
Still green  
Laying there by the road  
  
Too much emotion for a girl  
She let her heart become her world  
What world that God has never rocked  
For a sunder we are taught  
Had she been wise and she'd have known  
She could feed him love alone  
  
She should of known the day would come  
When he would quit her just for crumbs  
He needed fresh young meat to love  
And left her heart and mind to starve

It changes as it goes

I'd be something to see  
  
At seventeen I had me a diamond  
And a string of pearls  
The men said they preffered me  
To the other girls  
They took me to the best places  
But I could read it on their faces

To get on a Greyhound, get out of this town  
And leave it all behind

While she plays  
The man I love has never heard of ""Ruby's Place""  
When he holds her with affection  
And he uses that old expression

So begins the seduction  
As we succumb to desire  
Your body aches for more  
Why are you so surprised  
When you're born with the hunger  
The hunger never dies  
When you're born with the hunger  
The hunger - it never dies

Like I'm leaving in awhile

You were mine  
Now I got this feeling  
You'll be the next in line

Like to make a song last forever  
But the next dance won't be mine

That's loving on borrowed time  
  
My old love's broken pieces  
And I ain't met the new  
You're here in the middle  
Hanging on until I do  
Cause I'm a train that stops  
At every station down the line  
You're a fool so desperate  
That you'll ride on borrowed time

Then all you need is money and a mouth full of honey  
And if you play your cards right after dancin? all night  
You won't have to walk home alone  
You won't have to walk home alone  
Boys you can hang loose and slip up real cool  
But if that lady has a love noose  
She might never let you go  
And if you think that maybe you're too young  
And you just can not cope  
The grab a razor sharp pair of cutting shears  
And cut a hole right in the rope  
Snip a hole right in the rope

If you ain't got a dime  
You can't hook a fish if you ain't got a line  
You won't catch the bus if you're not there on time  
Well if you wake up tomorrow morning  
You can't remember what you did  
Just ring up some of your friends  
And they'll tell you just how low you slid  
Oh don't be ashamed of anything you hear  
After all you can't be blame  
When you're drinking so much beer  
Hey don't you worry  
That what you did just wasn't right  
Just remember brothers and sisters  
After every day?s another night  
Just remember brothers and sisters  
After every day?s another night

How my home's anywhere  
Knowing that I know you care  
And how nothing I see

Was to give and give

I followed him around in traveling shows  
Along the main county lines  
Watching him drinking his mind away  
Not ever knowing my name at time  
Each night when the show closed down  
He used to tell me of his dreams  
He was wearing new French suits  
While I mended my torn jeans

Then one night in Santa Fe  
The horses stop going around  
There he was my poor rich man  
Lying on the Mexico ground  
All the sad music of his life  
Is still spinning in my mind  
The carousel starts up again  
And I found my place in life

The marks of men her fortune she had won  
Couldn't see through the tinted glass,  
She said ""home James"" and he hit the gas  
I followed her to some darkened room,  
She took my money, she said ""I'll be with you soon""  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve  
She told me more about me than I knew myself  
  
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three  
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me  
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack,  
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black  
She said the man you love is secretly true  
To someone else who is very close to you  
My advice is that you leave this place,  
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face

Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done

So I ran home and crawled in my bed,  
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said  
Then I remembered her strange perfume,  
And how I smelled it was in my own room!  
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man,  
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand  
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor,  
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore  
  
Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one  
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done  
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve

I'd trade a lifetime for this night together

Every time I see you  
I'm on fire, every time we touch  
Can't you feel me burnin' with desire  
Baby feel warm, give me some  
Emotional fire  
Emotional fire  
  
There's a feelin' when I'm here beside you  
Couldn't leave you and I wouldn't try to  
Baby, I'd only need you again  
There ain't nothin' that can break this fever  
The love gets stronger and the passion deeper  
Hold on, hold on  
  
I can't let go 'cause there's no stoppin' this

I can't wait 'til the night comes fallin'

We're not ready to give up until we're crawling  
Don't make it easy on ourselves  
Climbing risk it all if you ain't living you're surviving  
Tell me why you dip you're toes when you could dive in  
Don't be scared to hurt yourself  
Take your heart back off the shelf  
  
Love covers you up in a landslide  
Love pulls you under like a riptide  
Loves when you crash trying to handglide  
Loves when you're running and there's no light  
Love is a song when you've got no defense  
Love is a rock we throw ourselves against  
Love is the healing of a broken heart  
The story behind all of my favorite scars  
All of my favorite scars  
I love my favorite scars  
  
High wire don't look down because below you is a raging fire  
But love is waiting for you on the other side  
We're not easy on ourselves  
So take your heart back off the shelf  
  
Love covers you up in a landslide  
Love pulls you under like a riptide  
Loves when you crash trying to handglide  
Loves when you're running and there's no light  
Love is a song when you've got no defense  
Love is a rock we throw ourselves against  
Love is the healing of a broken heart  
The story behind all of my favorite scars

I heard someone say  
Must be a whisper in the wind  
'Cause you're too far away

I could swear I saw you next to me  
Saying , oh I'm coming home  
You'll never spend another night alone

Remember when love was innocent  
There was never a better time  
But you know those fires of Eden  
Still burn in this heart of mine  
  
The morning's uncertain  
It's a nervous day  
And I look for a reason  
Why I should feel this way  
  
I hear a voice run before  
Drifting through my open door  
Saying it's alright  
We're going to light those flames tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And don't you wonder  
How we drifted so far  
When we belong to each other  
We were miles apart  
  
And there's a place  
That was meant for the two of us  
And when you touch the embers  
You feel my love  
As strong as it ever was

We've ever had a cry  
To keep away the reasoning of why we lie  
It only leads me down a lonely road  
And strange of fates as a world to  
A new and different time or place  
To live away the time of day so we can race  
Exactly what we choose just not to believe  
And ooh  
Happy was the day we met  
Never could I ever forget you  
I knew too well not to stay  
We paid our price turn our heads  
Close our eyes and sacrifice  
Excuses of love  
That once was warm has turned to ice  
But only leave me cold and so alone  
Now memories of years and fun  
Can only turn my eyes to see  
All the good that's been undone  
But I believe we're lucky just to learn  
From what we were  
And ooh  
Happy was the day we met  
Never could I ever forget you

Oh if you go away  
Oh, you so happy baby

And I knew that he would stay  
And he held me and he loved me

It was easy for me to say goodbye  
Watch him walk right out the door  
Tellin' myself I'd forget his face  
Like all the other times before  
And I was halfway through the afternoon  
When I knew that I was wrong  
  
He was spinning around inside my head

So maybe some night while the music plays  
Though I don't know where or when  
I'll be walking into some crowded room

Got a ticket to my destination.  
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.  
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.  
Homeward bound,  
I wish I was,  
Homeward bound,  
Home where my thought's escaping,  
Home where my music's playing,  
Home where my love lies waiting  
Silently for me.  
  
Ev'ry day's an endless stream  
Of cigarettes and magazines.  
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories  
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,  
Homeward bound,  
I wish I was,  
Homeward bound,  
Home where my thought's escaping,  
Home where my music's playing,  
Home where my love lies waiting  
Silently for me.  
  
Tonight I'll sing my songs again,  
I'll play the game and pretend.  
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity  
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.  
Homeward bound,  
I wish I was,  
Homeward bound,  
Home where my thought's escaping,  
Home where my music's playing,  
Home where my love lies waiting

Only to be with you, only to be with you  
I have run, I have crawled  
Well, I have scaled these city walls  
These city walls only to be with you  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
Well, I have kissed honey lips  
Felt the healing, fingertips  
It burned like fire, this burning desire  
I have spoke tongue of angels  
And I have held hand of the devil  
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
I believe in the kingdom come  
When all the colors bleed into one  
Bleed into one and yes, I'm still running  
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains  
Carried the cross of my shame  
Of my shame and you know, I believed it  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for  
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

He said he would always stay  
But I was cruel  
I treated him like a fool

In the palm of my hand  
And rivers that ran through everyday  
I must have been mad  
I never knew what I had  
Until I threw it all away  
Until I threw it all away  
  
Love is all there is  
It makes the world go around  
Love and only love  
It can't be deny  
No matter what you think about it  
You can't do without it  
Take a tip from one who's tried  
  
So if you find someone  
Gives you all his love  
Take it to your heart  
Don't let it stray  
Ah one thing's for certain  
You're surely gonna be hurtin'  
If you throw it all away  
If you throw it all away

Cher,I Walk Alone,/c/cher/i+walk+alone_21067605.html,"There's a poet in me that remembers  
And there's an honesty in every word  
There's a dancer that feels her own beat  
And there's a daughter who loves  
  
There's a sinner in my bones  
And there's a joker in my head  
There are secrets in my soul  
And there are sorries that I have never said  
  
But there's a time to dance  
Time to laugh  
Time to cry  
Time to go  
Time to grieve  
Time to come  
  
Oh, I still got time to cope  
Time to hope  
Time to play  
Time to grow  
But for now I gotta walk alone  
I gotta walk alone  
  
There's a tight rope that I've been walking  
There's a daisy in my hair  
There's a heartbreak that has taught me  
Of what is raging  
And there's only love and fear  
  
There's a sadness in my confessions  
There's a healer howling at the moon  
And there's a gypsy in me that keeps on roaming  
And there's a an anger as I get closer to the truth  
  
But there's a time to dance  
Time to laugh  
Time to cry  
Time to go  
Time to grieve  
Time to come  
  
Oh, I still got time to cope  
Time to hope  
Time to play  
Time to grow  
But for now I gotta walk alone  
I gotta walk alone  
I gotta walk alone  
I've got to walk alone  
But for now I gotta walk alone  
  
Oh, I hear the thunder but I won't back down  
A soldier marches through the wrong side of town  
I'm gonna love you until I bleed  
And that's the story of me  
I gotta walk alone  
  
If they say time is everything  
There's a time to dance  
Time to laugh  
Time to cry  
Time to go  
Time to grieve  
Time to come  
  
Oh, I still got time to cope  
Time to hope  
Time to play  
Time to grow

Because you took him for a ride  
Because the time was on his side

Some fools rave, of happiness  
Of blissfulness, togetherness  
Oh, some fools,  
They fool themselves, I guess  
They're not fooling me  
And I know it isn't true  
God, I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie and it's  
Made to make you blue  
Love hurts, (ooooo) love hurts  
(Ooooo), love hurts  
  
And I know it isn't true  
Oh, I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie and it's  
Made to make you blue  
Cause love hurts  
Early in the morning you hurt,  
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts

Cher,Lovers Forever,/c/cher/lovers+forever_21067604.html,"Imagine a life without death or disease  
The kind of power to bring a rich man to his knees  
  
I offer you this  
But it comes with a price  
A moments pain for such a trifle sacrifice  
  
I can show you worlds no human eyes have seen  
I can show you worlds beyond all reasoning  
  
Surrender to me now  
And we'll be lovers for all time  
Angels and sublime  
We'll be lovers forever  
  
We'll live just like gods  
Reaching every desire  
We'll savor ecstasy with every kiss of fire  
  
I offer you more  
Than mere words can express  
And many mortals who have drained their souls for less  
  
With one gesture I can set your spirit free  
With one gesture you'll be mine eternally  
  
Surrender to me now

Cher,Mama,/c/cher/mama_10061214.html,"Chorus:  
Mama when my dollies have babies  
And I am a big lady  
Mama will a prince come and take me away  
  
When I said these things I believed in kings  
Then I didn't know love could hurt me so  
Slowly she replied, tears had filled her eyes  
Baby not so fast let your young life last  
  
Chorus  
  
I sang to her in fun, my teens had just began  
My age was not the same still we played the game  
Her eyes were filled with pride and slowly she replied  
Soon enough you'll be a very pretty bride  
  
Chorus  
  
Mama, will the hurt go away deep inside  
When I sang this song  
My poor world had gone along  
All my early dreams has turned to crystal streams  
My love it was last and more tears have past  
And left me just one thing a tender voice I sing

Many rivers to cross  
But I can't seem to find my way over  
Wandering I am lost  
As I travel along the white cliffs of dover.  
Yes I've got many rivers to cross  
And it's only my will that keeps me alive  
'Cause I've been licked, washed up for years  
And I merely survive because of my pride.  
  
And this lonliness won't leave me alone  
It's such a drag to be on your own  
Cuz my man left me and he didn't say why  
So I guess I'll have to cry.  
  
I've got many rivers to cross  
But just where to begin', I'm playing for time  
Cuz there've been times I find myself  
Thinking of committing, a dreadful crime.  
  
And this lonliness won't leave me alone  
It's such a drag to be on your own  
My man left me and he didn't say why  
So I guess I'll have to cry.

WRITER SONNY BONO  
  
  
Monday knows what it's all about  
She's the kind of girl that can do without  
She was mature at sixteen years  
She grew up fast she was raised on tears  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
Her ma was wind and her pa was rain  
She made her home in an empty train  
Her clothes were patched  
And shoes were worn  
She played with the sun  
And fought with the storm  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She bought a book and learned to read  
So no one could learnt what she heard  
She even ate a hershey bar  
To make her kisses sweeter  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She wonder by night  
When the sun was disarray  
Cause every one notice her in the day  
She wrote in her book  
That a flower is good  
But why is a weed so misunderstood  
Do do do do- do do do do  
  
She learned how to sing  
And she learned how to pray  
She learned it all in one short day  
But she never learned black from white  
She never even learn how to fight  
Do do do do- do do do do  
Do do do do- do do do do  
Do do do do- do do do do

I dropped by to pick up a reason  
For the thought that I caught that my head  
Was the event of the season  
Why in crowds  
Just a trace of my face  
Could seem so pleasin'  
I'll cop out to the change  
But a stranger is putting the tease on  
  
I was down on the ground  
When the messenger  
Wrote me a letter  
I was raised by the praise of a fan  
Who said I upset her  
Any girl in the world  
Could have easily known me much better  
She said  
You're strange, but don't change  
And I let her  
In a while when the smile on my face  
Turned to plaster  
Stick around while the clown who gets sick  
Does the trick of disaster  
For the race of my head and my face  
Is moving much faster  
  
Is it strange I should change  
I don't know  
Why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change  
  
I don't know, why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change  
I don't know, why don't you ask her  
Is it strange I should change  
  
Why don't you ask her

So, I looked it straight in the eye  
I jumped into the shower  
For 'bout an hour  
Aw it was fine  
Yeah, It helps me all the time  
It's soothin' to my mind  
Just to see those blues  
Go slippin' down the drain  
Now I usually have my breakfast  
Which consists of tasty spam  
Yeah, I could eat it all day long  
But I only love one brand  
And I can't find it way out here  
So, I have to take a pass  
And settle for some hash  
When I drive and you're not here  
Oh, sweet sweet spam

Only heroes are allowed  
To run free, that they could come back inside of me.

Must be the one that's bringing tears to your child's eyes.

Making music like you do.

Forgotten all my tears.

Not chewing, popin'!  
So I said to him, I said  
If you pop that gum one more time,

Now for the last number in our act we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, backflips, flipflops splits, spread eagles  
One right after the other  
Now, we were staying at the hotel cicero  
You know, boozing, having a few laughs when we runout of ice  
So, I go out to get some  
And when I came back, I open the door  
And I see  
Veronica and charlie doin number 17  
The spread eagle.  
Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completly blacked out, I can't
remember a thing  
And it wasn't til later, when I was washing the blood of my hands  
I even knew they were dead!  
  
They had it comeing, they had it coming  
They had it coming all along  
I didn't do it, but if I'd done it  
How could you tell me that I was wrong x2  
  
I loved elle lipshitz more then I could possibly say  
He was a sensetive guy  
A painter  
Everynight he went out looking for himself  
And on the way, he found,  
Ruth, gladis, rosemary and Irving  
You could say we broke up coz of artistic differences  
He saw himself alive,  
I saw him dead  
  
The dirty bum bum bum bum bum x2  
  
He had it coming, he had it coming  
He only had himself to blame  
Because he used us  
And he abused us  
It was a murder but not a crime  
  
He had it coming, he had it coming  
He had it coming all along  
We didn't do it  
But if we'd done it  
How could you tell us that we were wrong.
