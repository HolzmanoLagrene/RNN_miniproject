I put my conscience under a stone

Walked from where I had left it  
I hoped it couldn't be found

Chicago,Cry For The Lost,/c/chicago/cry+for+the+lost_20030054.html,"Something I forgot that I used to know  
Keeps on coming back around.  
Somewhere in the dark right before the dawn  
Like a light from down the hall.  
Suddenly some old familiar music  
Songs I know I've never heard before.  
I gotta play along I can't refuse it  
I hear the call.  
  
We've all been so proud of our blindness  
No kindness to share  
  
[Chorus]  
I used to cry for the lost  
Until I had to turn away.  
Then I looked inside, past the fool,  
And found some deeper words to say  
To bring us together.  
  
We can make it better  
We can make it right.  
  
We hide behind the veil of our own success,  
While we're following the rules.  
Our eyes refuse to see past our little hands  
To the never changing truth.  
Freedom needs to speak a little louder,  
Justice needs to try her other arm.  
Some of us could push a little harder  
To sound the alarm.  
And I see children marching  
And I hear the drums again  
  
I used to cry for the lost  
Until I had to turn away.  
Then I looked inside, past the fool,  
And found some deeper words to say.  
If we hope and pray,  
It will come, give it half a chance.  
Everyone, understand  
In our hearts and our mind,  
You know there's nothing left to hide,  
We're already there.  
  
I used to cry.  
Cry for the lost I was walking away.  
I used to try to find a reason.  
Then I looked inside,  
I used to mind every time I was walking away,  
I gotta find what I'm feeling  
To bring us together.

Don't you ever see the starvation in the city where you live  
All the needless hunger all the needless pain?  
  
I haven't been there lately, the country is so fine  
But my neighbors don't seem hungry 'cause they haven't got the time

Just for the day  
From your body  
Wouldn't want to be swept away  
Far away  
From the one that I love

Happy golden days of yore.  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more.  
  
Through the years we all will be together

Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now.

From the pieces of my heart that fall like rain from the sky

When you hear the sound of a mountain crashing down  
It's just my heart in pieces  
When I feel the hunger  
When I'm reaching out with a hundred thousand hands  
It's my heart in pieces  
  
No one cuts through my soul like you can  
I'm naked to the bone beside your empty hand  
I see your face and I remember  
I'm a prisoner of your fate, I'm a loser in the race

When you hear the sounds of a mountain crashing down  
It's just my heart in pieces  
When I feel the hunger  
When I'm reaching out with a hundred thousand hands  
It's my heart in pieces  
  
I walk the fine line, between fire and the ice  
The memory lives on  
There's always something to remind me  
Every teardrop falling  
When your voice keeps calling  
  
When you hear the thunder  
when you hear the sounds of a mountain crashing down  
It's just my heart in pieces  
When I feel the hunger  
When I'm reaching out with a hundred thousand hands  
It's my heart in pieces

Mountains lie before me

To reach a destination  
Of his own imagination  
  
A child of the sky  
A rider on the wind

A prisoner of time  
A dimensional crime

Winter stars above me  
With a woman who can love me  
And moonlight swept embraces  
Fill my space with joy and peace

then we'd wow the crowd again  
  
When she'd go  
I'd go  
we'd go  
  
Then those ding dong daddies started to roar  
whistled, stomped, stamped on the floor,  
yelling, screaming, begging for more,  
and we'd say  
Ok fellas, keep your socks on,  
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

to cheer the best attraction in town

And though I lose a friend, in the end you will know oh

But tomorrow might rain so I'll follow the sun

That something that I thought was love was misinterpreted  
  
But they were doing me a favor, a blessing in disguise

I wake up and I see your face  
Even in my dreams

To say what needs sayin' before you disappear  
But old friends say you're gone  
Long since moved on, now

Of my feelings for you  
I'm gonna have to live here in your shadow  
Until the skies are no longer blue!

I am opening the wall.  
Can there be no other chance?

And I wish for nothing else at all.  
Looking up I see her signal with her fingers through her hair  
Telling me the hands are clean.  
On the

I'll beat.

Children,Billy Blunder,/c/children/billy+blunder_20590474.html,"One rainy morning  
Without any warning  
A large umbrella crossed the street  
Big, black and shiny  
Covering someone tiny  
And all that we could see were two small feet  
  
In and out the traffic  
Dodging here and there  
That umbrella went with a Don't-Care air  
I said in wonder  
Who is that down under  
Hugging that umbrella like a teddy bear  
  
Horns started blaring  
Everyone was staring  
At that strange object in the street  
Big black and shiny  
Covering someone tiny  
And all that we could see were two small feet  
  
Then a young policeman  
Called out from his beat  
""That umbrella there has a boy down deep""  
He swooped down under  
Pulled out Billy Blunder  
Just a tiny truant from his morning's sleep  
  
Now Billy Blunder  
Who was once down under  
Recites by heart his safety code  
""When you are out  
In rain or hail or thunder  
Hold up your umbrella when you cross the road! ""

I know who's going with me  
I know who I love  
And my dear knows who I'll marry.  
  
I have stockings of silk  
And shoes of bright green leather  
Combs to buckle my hair  
And a ring for every finger.  
  
Feather beds are soft  
And painted rooms are bonnie  
But I would give them all  
For my handsome winsome Johnny.  
  
Some say he is poor  
But I say he's bonnie  
Fairest of them all  
Is my handsome winsome Johnny.

Children,Irish Lullaby,/c/children/irish+lullaby_20795087.html,"Written By: J. Are. Shannon in 1913, Copyright Unknown  
  
Over in Killarney  
Many years ago,  
Me Mither (My Mother) sang a song to me  
In tones so sweet and low.  
Just a simple little ditty,  
In her good 'ould' (old) Irish way,  
And I'd give the world if she could sing  
That song to me this day.  
  
""Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li,  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, hush now, don't you cry!  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li,  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, that's an Irish lullaby. ""  
  
Oft in dreams I wander  
To that cot again,  
I feel her arms a-huggin' me  
As when she held me then.  
And I hear her voice a-hummin'  
To me as in days of yore,  
When she used to rock me fast asleep  
Outside the cabin door.  
  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,  
Too-ra-loo-ra-li,  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,  
Hush, now don't you cry!  
  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,  
Too-ra-loo-ra-li,  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,  
That's an Irish lullaby.

A burnin' bush told me just the other day  
That I should go to Egypt and say,  
""It's time to let my people be free -  
Listen to God if you won't listen to me!""  
  
CHORUS  
  
Well me and and my people goin' to the Red Sea,  
With Pharaoh's best army comin' after me.  
I took my staff, stuck it in the sand,  
And all of God's people walked on dry land.  
Singin...  
  
CHORUS  
  
Now Pharaoh's army was a-comin' too,  
So whattaya think that God did do?  
Had me take my staff and clear my throat,  
And all of Pharaoh's army did the dead man's float.  
  
CHORUS  
  
Well that's the story of the stubborn goat.  
Pharaoh should've know that chariots don't float.  
The lesson is simple, it's easy to find,  
When God says, ""GO!"" you had better mind!

Hold your body by your legs and hips

Massaging my back

When you throw it back babe  
Girl it might be too much  
Babe if you keep doing that  
I got that pillow for your knees right here  
Baby can you make it disappear  
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear  
Then I wanna make you holler

One last time, let me take my time, do it to you right  
Buildings and bridges maybe falling down  
But that won't stop me from turning that thing around  
Girl yeah  
Won't you come on over and we can treat it like it's the motherfucking  
End of the world

Feels like I'm four years old all over again  
Because I'm just running fast and should be walking  
Saying when I grow up you gon' see  
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy  
  
I guess I was faking cause look at all the money I'm making  
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love
