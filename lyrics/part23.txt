Chris Brown,Better On The Other Side,/c/chris+brown/better+on+the+other+side_20840424.html,"[Diddy talking]  
I remember the first time I seen you moonwalk,  
I believed I could do anything,  
You made the world dance,  
You made the music come to life  
  
[Chris brown - Chorus]  
This the type of song that make the angels cry,  
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?  
Why you had to go, go  
I know its better on the other side,  
You were chosen from the sky  
Never gon let you go,  
  
[The Game]  
Whos Michael Jackson,  
Your Michael Jackson,  
I'm Michael Jackson,  
We all Michael Jackson,  
I guess what I'm asking is everybody bow their head for a legend don't breathe
for a second,  
Now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about,  
So you can hear my message, my confession,  
Someone tell Usher, I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched
him, like he touched me, like he touched you,  
So carry on his legacy, something I must do, so I trust you lighting candles,
concrete visuals, me and my brothers listen to jackson 5 in the living room,  
First thing I did when I heard was call puff,  
Cos him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us,  
Who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead, him and Mike Jackson gonna take
us to the ledge.  
  
[Chorus:]  
This the type of song that make the angels cry,  
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?  
Why you had to go, go  
I know its better on the other side,  
You were chosen from the sky  
Never gon let you go,  
  
As I'm pouring out this liquor candles start to flicker,  
When list my air ones, mj was my nier.  
Not the one that play ball, the one with the hollywood star,  
And since I'm a hollywood star I'm gonna tell you my story,  
Never had a family that close, never see Barry Gordy walking through
interscope,  
Just like me they always had Mike in a scope,  
No matter what you say,  
I'm gonna love him and hes still dope,  
Let me take you back to 85 when I was in a zone, dancing for my momma thriller
jacket with all the zippers on,  
Now I'm doing 90 bout to crash in this Aston,  
Listening to Outcast, I'm sorry Mrs Jackson  
Anything I can ever do to better you your son was our king so we wont Corretta
you,  
I'm writing this letter to all the Jackson kids, we all Jackson kids, time to
let us through.  
  
[Chorus:]  
This the type of song that make the angels cry,  
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?  
Why you had to go, go  
I know its better on the other side,  
You were chosen from the sky  
Never gon let you go,

Got them screaming like they in the crowd

If you a star, I'm a whole planet  
Acting like she won't get it  
Have her run through the team like Jerome Bettis  
You don't want it, don't look for it  
Have your bitch on a surfboard, surfboard, surfboard  
If you want this money, gotta work for it Puff pass, what you lookin' at?  
Bust it wide open, make it nasty

You don't see me he same no more.  
It's hard to see the light.  
We're closing doors.  
Don't treat me like, like I'm invisible.  
Your tone with me is not the usual.  
We scream, we fight.  
Saying things that we both regret.  
And that's not right that you could just forget me like that.  
You never try.  
Always taking the easy route.  
Always taking the easy route.  
Never wanting to work it out.  
  
You want to be free.  
You want to leave me.  
I can't believe.  
'Cause without you, Baby, I'm incomplete.

Like a faded picture where you can't see my face.  
I'm scratched out, erased.  
  
In memory of what we used to call love,  
I reminisce what used to be us.  
Remember when, when I was the most important to you?  
But now I'm a ghost.  
The trust has died.  
There's no way we can bring it back.  
We live a lie, no bars, no strings attached.  
It's in your eyes, a part of you just wants me back.  
All of me just wants you back.  
  
You wanna be free

Drake would say that you're ""The Best He Ever Had""

Everywhere you go, it follows  
Can't understand I still love you

There were other guys who thought the same thing about her

You're famous girl, girl, girl  
You're famous girl, girl, girl  
You're famous girl, girl, girl

Keisha would've told me I was sent from heaven  
Sorry B, I don't wear no ""Halo""  
You were first to play the game, though  
Sorry I bust the windows out your car  
I might of cheated in the beginning  
I was wrong for writing ""Disturbia""  
But I meant it in ""Forever"",  
We were supposed to be together  
And I can't let you go  
  
Said you thought you find the right man  
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me

Empty words are better left unspoken  
Too much pressure, I wished I was frozen  
See, we lost our way now  
I hope you're happy being famous, girl  
  
You're famous girl, girl, girl

The young boy just turned sixteen  
And I got six fours and hot bikes that I rock  
Keep three or four sweeties on my clock,  
But all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him  
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop,  
'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk  
That sassy tempo with that walk,  
Maybe the reason that all this teenies may never see me

Momma you may be three years older but you hot (gimme that)  
You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)

What ya body got a young boy ready to do  
If you take a chance to let me put them things on you,  
I could show you why I make them straight A's in school  
I'm a hustler! Trust my frame and age

Can't decide what's make believe or real  
Am I awake or am I still asleep?  
It's killing me,

And the craziest thing is that you already know  
How to decipher the signs on the side of the road oh woah
