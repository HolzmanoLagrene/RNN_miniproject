The truth has frozen into stone  
And hope lies freezing in the midnight air  
Though dark our days may seem  
This is a different dream  
Their freedom light don't shine at all  
  
So I will light a candle for you  
Keep it burning in the night  
And pray that you are all right  
I will light a candle for you  
Little candle burning bright  
  
When school yard heroes disappeared  
The little girl, she stands alone  
Oh I believe you if you say  
A prayer can help to get her home  
  
So I will light a candle for you  
Keep it burning in the night  
And pray that you are all right  
I will light a candle for you

She needs it every day  
But speak of love

Oh you don't need to dream  
When you know you can fly

See her laugh and run away

Standing here in the rain  
I've been thinking how, how much happier  
I have been since you came  
Staring down at the sidewalk shining  
Satin winds floating down  
Change the crystals on ladies faces  
I think I'll stick around  
Laden gutters, flowing over  
Hit the streets and explode  
Young girls laughing and make up streaming  
Go running down the road  
I've been thinking and too much drinking  
And things I just don't dare to say  
It's still raining but who's complaining  
It's just one of those days

For doing what we do

Chris Rea,The Road To Hell (Part 2),/c/chris+rea/the+road+to+hell+part+2_20927292.html,"Well I'm standing by the river  
But the water doesn't flow  
It boils with every poison you can think of  
And I'm underneath the streetlight  
But the light of joy I know  
Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows  
And the perverted fear of violence  
Chokes the smile on every face  
And common sense is ringing out the bell  
This ain't no technological breakdown  
Oh no, this is the road to hell  
  
And all the roads jam up with credit  
And there's nothing you can do  
It's all just pieces of paper flying away from you  
Oh look out world, take a good look  
What comes down here  
You must learn this lesson fast and learn it well  
This ain't no upwardly mobile freeway  
Oh no, this is the road  
Said this is the road  
This is the road to hell

Chris Rea,The Things Lovers Should Do,/c/chris+rea/the+things+lovers+should+do_20030672.html,"Standing in the half light, wondering if you can  
There stands the priest of sinners, consolation in his hands  
Though he prays he won't need it, he keeps it by his side  
Waiting for the face up and the answer in her eyes  
All while the music's playing a backdrop serenade  
There's only one point of view  
To be doing the things, things that lovers should do  
  
Disco-queens in dancestep, moving face to face  
All tangled up in neon don't think it's some disgrace  
The blue western denim, the east coats razor edge  
The European fashion, the leathers and re-threads  
All while the music's playing a backdrop serenade  
There's only one point of view  
To be doing the things, things that lovers should do

The one I've been waiting for  
The one I've been dreaming of  
There she goes, but she'll never be mine  
Wasted all of my chances  
Run clean out of time  
  
There she goes with the wind in her hair  
And a smile on her face  
She doesn't know what I'd give just for one moment  
To be in his place  
Anyway  
Take a look, there she goes  
Take a look, there she goes  
  
There she goes with the wind in her hair  
And a smile on her face  
She doesn't know what I'd give just for one moment

Elton John:  
There's a calm surrender  
To the rush of day  
When the heat of the rolling world  
Can be turned away  
An enchanted moment  
And it sees me through  
It's enough for this restless warrior  
Just to be with you  
  
And can you feel the love tonight?  
It is where we are  
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer  
That we've got this far  
And can you feel the love tonight  
How it's laid to rest?  
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best  
  
There's a time for everyone  
If they only learn  
That the twisting kaleidoscope  
Moves us all in turn  
There's a rhyme and reason  
To the wild outdoors  
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager  
Beats in time with yours  
  
Christina Aguilera:  
And baby, baby, can you feel the love tonight?  
It is where we are, where we are, it is where we are  
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer  
That we got this far, got this far, ooh, that we, that we got this far  
  
Elton John:  
And can you feel the love tonight  
How it's laid to rest?  
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best  
  
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

He really got me working up an appetite  
He had tattoos up and down his arm  
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm  
He's a one stop shop, makes the panties drop

We drank champagne, and we danced all night  
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise (a big surprise)

Christina Aguilera,Change,/c/christina+aguilera/change_21110983.html,"When I was young, I would look in the mirror  
Didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer  
Yeah, I remember being filled with such wonder  
Before learning that the world can be harsher  
  
Who you love or the colour of your skin  
Or the place that you were born or grew up in  
Shouldn't decide how you should be treated  
'Cause we're all the same when everybody's breathing  
  
Waiting for a change to set us free  
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me  
Waiting for hope to come around  
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found  
Waiting for a change  
Waiting for a change (change, change)  
  
For all the brave, and the souls who went before us  
Stand tall, be proud and lift your voices  
Let 'em know who we are, and our choices  
And one day we won't have to sing this chorus  
  
Waiting for a change to set us free  
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me  
Waiting for hope to come around  
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found

The bet was on my heart  
But when I looked away  
You caught me off guard  
The tricks were hard to catch  
But now I see right through  
No more hurting me  
No more loving you  
Just wasted all my time  
Empty promises and lies  
Now my fantasy has died  
  
I never asked for  
These broken pieces  
You left me with  
You took advantage  
Did so much damage  
Right when you hit  
You knew just what to target in me  
When you shot, I dropped to my knees  
How could this be?  
I fell for the enemy  
  
A fantastic debut  
Taking part in your masquerade  
I starred as a fool  
And while the music played  
I gave my heart to you  
Boy, how was I confused  
I was only being used  
  
I never asked for  
These broken pieces

Did so much damage

Boy, you wish that I was weak  
But now you're never gonna break me

Want your skin up against mine  
Move my hips to the baseline  
Let me get mine, you get yours  
Hang a please don't disturb sign  
Put my back into a slow grind  
Sending chills up and down my spine  
Let me get mine, you get yours

Understand that you can't question me  
The feelings that you call, it ain't my fault

What we have has got to be commitment free  
Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin', hittin'  
Underneath the sheets

For everything you do I turn to you.  
(oh yeah oh)  
  
For the arms to be my shelter through all the rain.  
For truth that will never change.  
For someone to lean on.  
  
For a heart I can rely on through anything.  
For the one who I can run to  
Oh yeah  
(so do you oh yeah)  
  
For a shield from the storm, for a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm  
(to keep me safe and warm, yeah)  
I turn to you (I turn to you)  
For the strength (for the strength yea)  
To be strong, for the will to carry on.  
For everything you do (everything you do)  
For everything that's true  
For everything you do  
For everything that's true  
I turn to you.

Verse:  
The world seems so cold,  
when i face so much all alone.  
A little scared to move on  
and knowing how fast I have grown.  
And i wander just where i fit in  
oh the visions alive in my head  
  
chorus:  
i will be strong on my own  
i will see through the rain i will find my way  
i will keep on traveling this road  
'till i finally reach my dream till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny  
  
verse 2:  
i can't lt go now,  
even when darkness surrounds.  
but if i hold on, yer, i will show the world  
all the things that you never expected to see from little old me,this
pittsburgh girl.  
and i wander just where my place is,  
close my eyes and i remind my self this. oh yer

i will be strong on my own

It comforts me, it keeps me  
alive each day of my life.  
Always guiding me, providing me  
with the hope i desperateley need.  
Well i gotta believe there's something out there meant for me.  
o i get on my knees, praying i will receive,  
the courage to grow and the faith to love.  
and...

Of a place I love  
Even more than I usually do  
And although I know  
It's a long road back  
I promise you  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents by the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find you  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas

Christina Aguilera,I'm Doing Fine,/c/christina+aguilera/im+doing+fine_20640838.html,"How can I forget the night we met?  
I can still remember what you wore.  
I had the strangest feeling like we'd met before.  
Maybe it was something that you said.  
How can I forget the night we met?  
  
How can I forget when we first touched?  
Never thought that I would want someone so much.  
I looked in your eyes and then I knew for sure  
You would be my love forevermore.  
As you slept, I kept thinking of the night we met.  
  
Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night,  
But I remember everything about you,  
How you came and changed my life.  
  
And how can I forget those wedding bells?  
You looked like an angel, I remember well  
How we danced all night and never touched the ground.  
How can I forget the night we met?  
  
Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night,  
But I remember everything about you,  
How you came and changed my life.  
  
How can I forget your greatest gift?  
I swore I saw your eyes when I first looked at his,  
And when you cried, the tears were falling from my eyes  
As I held our baby, held on to his first breath.  
How can I forget the first night that we met?  
And how can I forget that night?  
How can I forget the night we met

Christina Aguilera,I'm Ok,/c/christina+aguilera/im+ok_20030789.html,"Once upon a time there was a girl  
In her early years she had to learn  
How to grow up living in a war that she called home  
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm  
Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face  
Every time my father's fist would put her in her place  
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room  
Hoping it would be over soon  
  
[Chorus]  
Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same  
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid  
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave  
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday  
  
And I'm OK  
  
I often wonder why I carry all this guilt  
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built  
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door  
The echo of a broken child screaming ""please no more""  
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done  
To you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's not so easy to forget  
All the marks you left along her neck  
When I was thrown against cold stairs  
And every day I'm afraid to come home  
In fear of what I might see there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm OK  
I'm OK

Hey, oh oh, hey  
  
He comes from a foreign place  
An island far away  
Intrigues me with every move  
Til' I'm breathless, I'm helpless  
Can't keep my cool  
Steals my heart when he takes my hand  
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band  
I feel his finger tips, grip my hips  
And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss  
  
Mama used to warn me  
To beware of those Latin lovers  
She said I gave my heart too soon  
And that's how I became your mother  
I said hey mama, you seem to forget  
I'm not in love yet  
Sweet talk don't win me over  
But I realized  
Big brown eyes can hypnotize  
When he says  
  
I am full blood boricua  
Reads the tattoo on his arm  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero  
I begin to give in with no hesitation  
Can't help my infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
It's pure infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
Hey  
  
Skin the color of cinnamon  
His eyes light up and I melt within  
Feels so good it must be a sin  
I can't stop what I started  
I'm giving in  
He brings life to my fantasies  
Sparks a passion inside of me  
Finds the words when I can not speak  
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me  
  
Mama used to warn me  
Not to rush love with another  
She said I'm not trying to lecture  
I just care about my daughter  
Ay mama, you seem to forget  
I never will let  
A man control my emotions  
But when he smiles (when he smiles)  
I feel like a little child  
When he says  
  
I am full blood boricua  
Reads the tattoo on his arm (whoa, whoa)  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero  
I begin to give in with no hesitation  
Can't help my infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
It's pure infatuation  
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)  
  
Caught between my mama's words  
And what I feel inside  
I'm wanting to explore his world  
But a part of me wants to hide  
Should I risk it, can't resist it  
This has caught me by surprise  
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico  
I can't hold back no more  
Let's go tonight  
Ooh, hey  
  
You adore me, never be lonely, oh  
  
I am full blood boricua (boricua)  
Reads the tattoo on his arm (on his arm)  
He tells me, mami I need ya  
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)  
Getting lost in el ritmo  
He whispers te quiero, te quiero (oh, quiero)

It is now time  
The one and only  
There never will be another  
Christina Aguilera  
That's how music should sound  
  
Oh yeah  
I've waited for some time  
To get inside the minds  
Of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside  
It's like an endless ride  
Feeling the lows and highs  
Of every lyric and melody  
Every single rhyme  
So here I stand today  
In tribute I do pay  
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way  
And so to God I pray that he will give me strength  
To carry forward the gift of song in his good faith  
In his good faith  
  
I'm going back to basics  
To where it all began  
I'm ready now to face it  
I wanna understand  
What made the soul singers  
And the blues figures  
That inspired a higher generation  
The jazz makers, and the ground breakers  
They gave so much of themselves and dedication  
  
So here I stand today  
In tribute I do pay  
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way

Man made electric light to take us out of the dark  
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

no no  
Put your trust in me  
And I'll make you see  
  
[Chorus]  
No the rain won't last forever  
Find a way to make it better  
Long as we can stand together  
Love will find a way  
Gonna make a new tomorrow  
Say good-bye to tears and sorrow  
Better listen when I say  
Love will find a way  
  
Somebody tried to tell me love  
doesn't last forever  
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams  
After all is said and done  
We're still here together  
Never listen to the lies and jealousy  
  
You better stop  
Don't you let them turn you around  
You better stop  
Hang onto this love that we've found  
Nothing ever say  
Can stand in our way  
  
[Chorus]

Christina Aguilera,Loving Me 4 Me,/c/christina+aguilera/loving+me+4+me_20249128.html,"People ask if I'm in love with you  
Because I'm sitting here with your picture  
And smiling to myself  
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you  
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through  
And I blush as I say yes  
  
What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me  
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak  
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being  
With abilities to set me free  
Free, make me be me  
Makes me want to say  
  
Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss  
I must admit it's a part of me  
You please me, complete me, believe me  
Like a melody  
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof  
We were meant to be  
But the best quality that's hookin' me  
Is that you're loving me for me  
Is that you're loving me for me  
  
People ask why I'm in love with you  
Well, let me start by saying  
You got my heart by just being who you are  
And what we got is between me and you  
It doesn't matter about the money I make  
Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star  
  
Unconditionally you're there for me  
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, so sweet  
This is meaningful, is incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable  
The way I feel, so sweet  
Makes me want to say  
  
Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss  
I must admit it's a part of me  
You please me, complete me, believe me  
Like a melody  
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof  
We were meant to be  
But the best quality that's hookin' me  
Is that you're loving me for me  
Is that you're loving me for me  
  
Its so amazing how something so sweet  
Has come and rearranged my life  
I've been kissed by destiny  
Oh, heaven came and saved me  
An angel was placed at my feet  
This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me  
  
Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes  
No cover ups, push ups  
With him, I don't have to put on a show  
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin  
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in  
He's real,he's honest, he's loving me for me  
Yeah

What if I never knew  
What if I never found you  
I'd never had this feeling  
In my heart  
  
How did this come to be  
I don't know how you found me  
But from the moment I saw you  
Deep inside my heart  
I knew  
  
Baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  
  
I wanted someone like you  
Someone that I could hold onto  
And give my love  
Until the end of time  
  
But forever was just a word  
Something I'd only heard about  
But now you're always there for me  
When you say forever  
I'll believe  
  
Baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  
  
Maybe all we need  
Is just a little faith.  
Cause baby, I believe  
That love will find a way.  
Hey..  
  
Oh baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
From now till eternity  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny

His virtue doth parade  
  
Thou knowest not my dim witted friend  
  
The picture thou hast made  
  
Thy vacant brow and thy tousled hair  
  
Conceal thy good intent  
  
Thou noble upright, truthful, sincere  
  
And slightly dopey gent  
  
  
  
You're my funny valentine  
  
Sweet comic valentine  
  
You make me smile with my heart  
  
Your looks are laughable  
  
Unphotographable  
  
Yet you're my favorite work of art  
  
Is your figure less than greek  
  
Is your mouth a little weak  
  
When you open it to speak  
  
Are you smart?  
  
But don't change a hair for me  
  
Not if you care for me  
  
Stay little valentine stay  
  
Each day is valentine's day!

She always dreamt of a fairytale life  
And all the things your money can't buy  
She thought daddy was a wonderful guy

It was the moment she took on his name  
He took his anger out on her face  
She kept all of her pain locked away

From all of the tears you have shed  
Oh mother, don't look back  
Cause he'll never hurt us again  
  
So mother, I thank you

You got me, I got you  
Together we always pull through  
We always pull through  
We always pull through

That she knew she just had to leave him  
So many voices inside of her head  
Saying over and over and over,  
""You deserve much more than this.""  
  
She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide  
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)  
So tired of defending her life, she could have died  
Fighting for the lives of her children

Christina Aguilera,Over The River And Through The Woods,/c/christina+aguilera/over+the+river+and+through+the+woods_20756160.html,"Over the river  
And through the woods  
To Grandmother's house  
We go  
The horse knows the way  
To carry the sleigh  
Through white  
And drifted snow  
  
Over the river  
And through the woods  
Oh  
How the wind does blow  
It stings the toes  
And bites the nose  
As over the ground we go  
  
Over the river  
And through the woods  
To have a full day of play  
Oh, hear the bells  
Ringing ting-a-ling-ling  
For it is Christmas Day  
  
Over the river  
And through the woods  
Trot fast my dapple gray  
Spring o'er the ground  
Just like a hound  
For this is Christmas Day  
  
Over the river  
And through the woods  
And straight through  
The barnyard gate  
It seems that we go  
So dreadfully slow  
It is so hard to wait  
  
Over the river  
And through the woods  
Now Grandma's cap I spy  
Hurrah for fun  
The pudding's done  
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie

Christina Aguilera,Save Me From Myself,/c/christina+aguilera/save+me+from+myself_20471137.html,"It's not so easy loving me  
It gets so complicated  
All the things you've gotta be  
Everything's changin'  
But you're the truth  
I'm amazed by all your patience  
Everything I put you through  
  
When I'm about to fall  
Somehow you're always waitin'  
With your open arms to catch me  
You're gonna save me from myself  
From myself, yes  
You're gonna save me from myself  
  
My love is tainted by your touch  
'Cause some guys have shown me aces  
But you've got that royal flush  
I know it's crazy everyday  
Well, tomorrow may be shaky  
But you never turn away  
  
Don't ask me why I'm cryin'  
'Cause when I start to crumble  
You know how to keep me smilin'  
You always save me from myself  
From myself, myself  
You're gonna save me from myself  
  
I know it's hard, it's hard  
But you've broken all my walls  
You've been my strength, so strong  
  
And don't ask me why I love you  
It's obvious your tenderness  
Is what I need to make me  
A better woman to myself  
To myself, myself  
You're gonna save me from myself

No matter where i look, I feel your stare,  
I thought it was forgotten, or at least forgiven,  
You're gonna keep punishing me till the day i leave him.  
  
I'm not unfaithful, i just couldn't resist love,  
I can't stay where i'm not getting enough,  
I trusted my instincts (for happiness) but they turned out untrue,  
It's my instincts (not me) to blame for hurting you.  
You seem unwilling to put it in the past,  
You're trying so hard to stop my love from lasting.  
  
Stop! take a minute and look at me,  
You want to be my lover not my enemy.  
  
No matter where i go, you're always there,  
No matter where i look, I feel your stare,  
I thought it was forgotten, or at least forgiven,

Christina Aguilera,Sing For Me,/c/christina+aguilera/sing+for+me_21047022.html,"Sometimes when I'm sitting on my bed  
Feeling so so lonely  
Wishing someone hold me  
All I have is three little notes playing in my head  
  
Outside I can cover all the scars  
Inside lie the words just pleading to be heard  
'Cause all I have are three million melodies to kill all the hurt  
Now I'm ready gonna sing 'em all out  
Sing 'em out just for myself  
I don't even care what the world thinks about how I sound  
  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
My whole heart comes out  
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied  
I'm singing till I'm winning, Imma sing all night  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
There's no place to hide  
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free  
I'm singing 'cause, I'm winning Imma sing for me  
  
I stand and believe in who I am  
Take shots at my heart but who am I to give up  
Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free  
My stage is the greatest in the world  
Give back to the ones who struggle with me stay true  
Reminding me to see my only chosen destiny  
And now I'm ready now I'm gonna sing it all out  
Sing it out just for myself  
I don't even care what the world thinks about how I sound  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
My whole heart comes out  
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied  
I'm singing till I'm winning Imma sing all night

Sing for myself  
Sing what I believe  
Make my whole heart come out  
Right where I am let the rain come down  
Sing for me (Sing for me)  
Sing for myself, sing what I believe  
Let my whole heart come out  
Right here right now make my own, my very own sound

Christina Aguilera,So Emotional,/c/christina+aguilera/so+emotional_20030741.html,"It's either black or white that's right  
We're making love or in a fight  
Sometimes you make me so blue  
  
But then it feels so good I knew it would  
You know the way to make me crazy  
I want to give it to you  
  
You make me feel so emotional  
I can't let go I'm so emotional  
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you  
I'm so emotional  
  
You take me high and low you know  
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go  
You're such a mystery to me  
  
But baby hot or cold, you got a hold  
Of my imagination  
I think you know what i mean  
  
You make me feel so emotional  
I can't let go I'm so emotional  
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you  
I'm so emotional  
  
Rain is falling down on me  
Suddenly the sun comes out  
Sometimes north or south of love  
But never out.

Christina Aguilera,Soar,/c/christina+aguilera/soar_20030797.html,"When they push when they pull  
Tell me you can hold on  
When they say you should change  
Can you lift your head high,  
And stay strong  
Will you give up, give in,  
When your hearts crying out,  
That it's wrong  
Will you love you for you  
At the end of it all  
  
In life there's going to be times  
When you're feeling low  
And in your mind insecurity  
Seems to take control  
We start to look outside ourselves  
For acceptance and approval  
We keep forgettin' that  
The one thing we should know is  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't be scared to fly alone  
Find a path that is your own  
Love will open every door  
Its in your hands  
The world is your  
Don't hold back and always know  
All the answers will unfold  
What are you waiting for  
Spread your wings and soar  
  
The boy who wonders  
Is he good enough for them  
Keeps tryin' to please em' all  
But he just never seems to fit in  
Then there's the girl who thinks  
She'll never be good enough for him  
Keeps tryin' to change  
And that's a game she'll never win  
  
Now In life there's going to be times  
When you're feeling low  
And in your mind insecurity  
Seems to take control  
We start to look outside ourselves  
For acceptance and approval  
We keep forgettin' that  
The one thing we should know is  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the mirror  
Is where she come face to face  
With her fears  
Her reflection-so foreign to her  
After all these years  
All of her life she has tried to be something  
Besides herself  
Now time has passed  
And she's ended up someone else with regret  
  
What is it in us that makes us feel the need  
To keep pretending  
Gotta let ourselves be  
  
[Chorus: x2]

To let something take control

I'm head over heels this time  
Unafraid to be open  
And thinking I'd be just fine  
But I found in the very end  
That it all depends  
  
'Cause love can lift you so high  
Or it'll leave you to die  
And it's not like you ever get to choose  
(Which way that it leads you)  
Ooh it can play with your mind  
Or make you feel so alive

That's what love can do

That's what love can do  
  
I guess now I get why  
They say love is a dangerous game  
'Cause when you think that you're winning  
You find out that you just been played  
You give and you sacrifice  
You make changes in your life  
Everyone's got advice

Fairy tales, sunset sails, it never fails  
'Til reality sets in  
I begin to comprehend how crazy this has been  
And I can't depend on  
Anyone for my happily ever after
