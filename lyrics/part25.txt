Christina Aguilera,Walk Away,/c/christina+aguilera/walk+away_20030801.html,"What do you do when you know something's bad for you  
And you still can't let go?  
  
I was naive  
Your love was like candy  
Artificially sweet  
I was deceived by the wrapping  
  
Got caught in your web  
And I learned how to bleed  
I was prey in your bed  
And devoured completely  
  
And it hurts my soul  
Cause I can't let go  
All these walls are caving in  
I can't stop my suffering  
I hate to show that I've lost control  
'Cause I, I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need to walk away from  
  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya  
Get away, walk away, walk away  
  
I should have known  
I was used for amusement  
Couldn't see through the smoke  
It was all an illusion  
  
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)  
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)  
We both can seduce  
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)  
  
I'm about to break  
I can't stop this ache  
I'm addicted to your allure  
And I'm fiendin' for a cure  
Every step I take  
Leads to one mistake  
I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need  
  
I can't mend  
This torn state I'm in  
Getting nothing in return  
What did I do to deserve  
The pain of this slow burn  
And everywhere I turn  
I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need to walk away from  
  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya  
  
Every time I try to grasp for air  
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over  
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,  
I let out a silent prayer  
Let it be over, over  
  
Inside I'm screaming  
Begging, pleading  
No more  
  
I don't know what to do  
My heart has been bruised  
So sad but it's true  
Each beat reminds me of you  
  
It hurts my soul  
'Cause I can't let go  
All these walls are caving in  
I can't stop my suffering  
I hate to show that I've lost control  
Cause I  
I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need, oh  
  
I'm about to break  
And I can't stop this ache  
I'm addicted to your allure  
And I'm fiendin' for a cure

Getting nothing in return  
What did I do to deserve  
The pain of this moment  
And everywhere I turn  
I keep going right back  
To the one thing that I need to walk away from  
  
I say  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya  
Get away, walk away, walk away  
  
Only thing I need to do is walk away  
  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya  
Get away, walk away, walk away  
  
I need to get away from ya  
I need to walk away from ya

Christina Aguilera,Welcome,/c/christina+aguilera/welcome_20471057.html,"Whoa, oh  
  
Welcome to the greatest show  
Greatest show on earth  
You've never seen before  
Here, the fairytale unfolds  
  
What's behind the smoke and glass?  
Painted faces, everybody wears a mask  
Are you selling them your soul?  
Well, you'll be left out in the cold  
  
Is it all blue skies  
Fun and games until you fall?  
Then you're left without anyone at all  
You're riding on a shooting star  
With a smile upon your face  
But soon the shine fades  
  
And you're left out all alone  
Wondering where did they all go?  
Oh  
  
Been jaded, hated  
Who'll be around when the limelight's faded?  
Been shut down, pushed out  
Made to smile when I wanted to frown  
  
Always taking a bow  
Always working the crowd  
Always making new grounds  
Always playing the clown  
Who'll be sticking it out?  
Who'll be staying around  
When the lights go down?

Three thousand miles from your kiss goodbye

Than I ever hoped for  
Ever hoped for

Christmas Songs,Christmas Dinner,/c/christmas+songs/christmas+dinner_20674346.html,"(Paul Stookey, 1963)  
  
And it came to pass on a Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight  
Outside standing, lonely boy-child  
Cold and shivering in the night  
  
On the street, every window  
Save but one, was gleaming bright  
And to this window walked the boy-child  
Peeking in saw, candle light  
  
Through other windows he had looked at turkeys  
Ducks and geese, cherry pies  
But through this window saw a grey-haired lady  
Table bare and tears in her eyes  
  
Into his coat reached the boy-child  
Knowing well there was little there  
He took from his pocket,  
His own Christmas dinner  
A bit of cheese, some bread to share  
  
His outstretched hands  
Held the food and they trembled  
As the door, it opened wide  
Said he, Would you share with me Christmas dinner  
Gently said she, Come inside  
  
The grey-haired lady brought forth to the table  
Glasses two and her last drop of wine  
Said she, Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas  
And especially, yours and mine  
  
And it came to pass on that Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight  
That in that town, the happiest Christmas  
Was shared by candle light

Christmas Songs,First Christmas,/c/christmas+songs/first+christmas_20674664.html,"This day a year ago, he was rolling in the snow  
With a younger brother in his father's yard  
Christmas break, a time for touching home,  
The heart of all he'd known  
And leaving was so hard  
  
Three thousand miles away,  
Now he's working Christmas Day  
Making double time for the minding of the store  
Well he always said, he'd make it on his own  
He's spending Christmas Eve alone  
First Christmas away from home  
  
She's standing by the train station,  
Pan-handling for change  
Four more dollars buys a decent meal and a room  
Looks like the Sally Ann place after all,  
In a crowded sleeping hall  
That echoes like a tomb  
  
But it's warm and clean and free,  
And there are worse places to be  
At least it means no beating from her Dad  
And if she cries because it's Christmas Day  
She hopes that it won't show  
First Christmas away from home  
  
In the apartment stands a tree,  
And it looks so small and bare  
Not like it was meant to be,  
Golden angel on the top  
It's not that same old silver star,  
You wanted for your own  
First Christmas away from home  
  
In the morning, they get prayers,  
Then it's crafts and tea downstairs  
Then another meal back in his little room  
Hoping maybe that ""the boys""  
Will think to phone before the day is gone  
Well, it's best they do it soon  
  
When the ""old girl"" passed away,  
He fell apart more every day  
Each had always kept the other pretty well  
But the kids all said the nursing home was best  
Cause he couldn't live alone  
First Christmas away from home  
  
In the common room they've got the biggest tree  
And it's huge and cold and lifeless  
Not like it ought to be,  
And the lit-up flashing Santa Claus on top  
It's not that same old silver star,  
You once made for your own  
First Christmas away from home

'Cause no matter how far away you roam  
When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze  
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home  
  
I met a man who lives in Tennessee  
And he was headin' for  
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie  
From Pennsylvania folks are trav'lin' down  
To Dixie's sunny shore  
From Atlantic to Pacific, gee,  
The traffic is terrific!  
  
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays  
'Cause no matter how far away you roam  
If you want to be happy in a million ways  
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home

Soon it will be Christmas

Though you're far away  
Your home is in my heart  
It's every where I go  
And I'll be waiting here  
'Til you're home to stay  
  
I think of Winters past  
When we were together  
The sweetest memories  
All come into play  
Your voice rings in my ear  
Just to let me know  
That you'll be here with me  
Home on Christmas day  
  
Angels calling from on high  
Will bring a starry sky  
To light the frosted  
Ground below  
So you will know  
Your way back home tonight  
A candle burns so bright  
To show the way  
  
I'll make a silent wish  
Just for you this Christmas  
To keep you safe and warm  
Never led astray  
That everywhere you go  
Is sheltered from the storm  
And that my Christmas wish  
Is with you every day  
Each and every day  
  
Angels callin' down to say  
They'll always know the way  
To lift you  
'Til you soar so high  
That I will see you  
In the sky above  
My Christmas gifts of love  
Will guide you back  
  
And now I promise you  
With all my heart  
This Christmas  
That all the love we shared  
Will never go away  
Your spirit's everywhere  
And I hope you know  
That you are always here  
Home on Christmas day

Only a hippopotamus will do  
Don't want a doll, no dinky tinker Toy  
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy  
  
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?  
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue  
Just bring him through the front door, that's the easy thing to do  
  
I can see me now on Christmas morning, creeping down the stairs  
Oh what joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes  
To see my hippo hero standing there  
  
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
Only a hippopotamus will do  
No crocodiles, no rhinoceroses  
I only like hippopotamuses  
And hippopotamuses like me too  
  
Mom says the hippo would eat me up, but then  
Teacher says a hippo is a vegeterian  
  
There's lots of room for him in our two-car garage  
I'd feed him there and wash him there and give him his massage  
I can see me now on Christmas morning, creeping down the stairs  
Oh what joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes

Why can't that feeling go on endlessly

What a wonderful world this would be

Telling Santa what to bring  
And the smile upon his tiny face  
Is worth more to me than anything

Making lots of games and toys

To bring them to the girls and boys  
Santa's just as nice as he can be  
There's just one little thing that worries me  
  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How is Santa goin' to use his sleigh  
In case of rain, will there be a train  
That'll speed him on his way  
If it doesn't snow on Christmas  
How will Santa get around to us  
If he breaks down on his way to town  
Will they let him use a bus  
  
I sent him a nice long letter  
And I hope it's not in vain  
I'd really feel much better  
If I knew he could fly a plane  
  
People say he has eight reindeer  
For the sleigh he's driving here  
But how'll he go, if it doesn't snow

That glorious song of old  
From angels bending near the Earth  
To touch their harps of gold  
Peace on the Earth, goodwill to men  
From heaven's all gracious king  
The world in solemn stillness lay  
To hear the angels sing  
  
Still through the cloven skies  
They come  
With peaceful wings unfurl  
And still  
Their heavenly music floats  
O'er all the weary world  
Above its sad and lowly plains  
They bend on hovering wing  
And ever o'er its Babel sounds  
The blessed angels sing  
  
O ye  
Beneath life's crushing load  
Whose forms are bending low  
Who toil along the climbing way  
With painful steps and slow  
Look now  
For glad and golden hours  
Come swiftly on the wing  
O rest beside the weary road  
And hear the angels sing  
  
For lo the days are hastening on  
By prophets seen of old  
When with the ever circling years  
Shall come the time foretold  
When the new heaven and earth  
Shall own the prince of peace  
Their King  
And the whole world  
Send back the song  
Which now the angels sing

And hearts will be glowing,  
When loved ones are near.

Yeah - you gotta put a little holiday in your heart  
  
It starts with you, it starts with me  
This ain't no stranger, he's family and it don't  
Matter if we agree  
It all comes down to love  
  
Put a little holiday in your heart  
It'll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you can't forget  
And if you wanna join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin' apart  
Well you know where to look  
Yeah - you gotta put a little holiday in your heart

Christmas Songs,River,/c/christmas+songs/river_20703685.html,"(Joni Mitchell)  
  
It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
They're putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
But it don't snow here  
It stays pretty green  
I'm going to make a lot of money  
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene  
  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
Oh I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
I made my baby cry.  
  
He tried hard to help me  
He put me at ease  
Lord, he loved me so naughty  
Made me weak in the knees  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
I'm so hard to handle  
I'm selfish and I'm sad  
Now I've gone and lost the best baby  
That I ever had  
  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
Oh I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I made my baby say goodbye  
  
It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
They're putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on.

Christmas Songs,Rocking Around The Christmas Tree,/c/christmas+songs/rocking+around+the+christmas+tree_20674300.html,"(Johnny Marks)  
  
Rocking around the Christmas tree  
At the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see  
Every couple tries to stop  
Rocking around the Christmas tree,  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some caroling.  
  
You will get a sentimental  
Feeling when you hear  
Voices singing let's be jolly,  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Rocking around the Christmas tree,  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new old-fashioned way.

You know Dasher and dancer  
And Prancer and Vixen,  
Comet and Cupid  
And Donner and Blitzen.  
But do you recall  
The most famous reindeer of all?  
  
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer  
(Reindeer)  
Had a very shiny nose  
(Like a light bulb)  
And if you ever saw it  
(Saw it)  
You would even say it glows  
(Like a flash light)  
All of the other reindeer  
(Reindeer)  
Used to laugh and call him names  
(Like Pinochio)  
They never let poor Rudolph  
(Rudolph)  
Play in any reindeer games  
(Like Monopoly)  
  
Then one foggy Christmas Eve  
Santa came to say  
(Ho Ho Ho)  
Rudolph with your nose so bright  
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?  
Then all the reindeer loved him  
(Loved him)  
And they shouted out with glee  
(Yippee)  
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer  
(Reindeer)  
You'll go down in history!""  
(Like george washington )

Lies  
I told them that we were doing fine, very much to their  
Surprise  
For how were they to know that here the ground was soaked  
In red  
Or that we could fill the valley with our dead.  
I started out and told them that by Christmas we'd begin  
To pack our bags and head on home to bring the new year  
In  
While all around me boys who help me sow last season's  
Crop  
By charging at the cannons till they drop  
  
I told my mother not to write cause we're always moving  
  
On  
I told my brother not to join cause he'd only fight me  
Gun  
But if we keep on much further retreating all the way  
Oh we'd all be going home just any day.

Christy Moore,A Pair Of Brown Eyes,/c/christy+moore/a+pair+of+brown+eyes_21007181.html,"One summer evening drunk as hell  
I sat there nearly lifeless.  
An old man in the corner sang,  
Where the water lilies grow.  
On the jukebox Johnny sang,  
About a thing called love.  
And it's ""how are you kid? What's your name?  
And what do you know?""  
  
In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky  
I lay down on the ground.  
The arms and legs of other men  
Were scattered all around.  
Some prayed and cursed, then cursed and prayed  
And then they prayed some more.  
And the only thing that I could see,  
Was a pair of brown eyes they were looking at me.  
When we got back, labeled parts one to three,  
There was no fairer brown eyes waiting for me.  
  
And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  
A rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  
And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  
For a pair of brown eyes,  
For a pair of brown eyes.  
  
I looked at him he looked at me,  
All I could do was hate him.  
While Ray and Philomena sang,  
Of my elusive dream.  
I saw the streams and the rolling hills,  
Where his brown eyes were waiting.  
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes,  
That waited once for me,  
That waited once for me.  
  
So drunk as hell I left the place,  
Sometimes walking, sometimes crawling.  
A hungry sound came through the breeze,  
So I gave the walls a talking.  
And I heard the sounds of long ago,  
From the old canal.  
And the birds were whistling in the trees,  
Where the wind was gently laughing.  
  
And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  
A rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  
And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  
For a pair of brown eyes,  
For a pair of brown eyes.

Christy Moore,All I Remember,/c/christy+moore/all+i+remember_20238317.html,"I was lured by the rocking horse  
Sweets and the bualadh bos  
Fifty wild boys to a room  
Sing lamh, lamh eile, the dish ran away with the spoon  
Black shoes and stockings for those who say don't  
Blue is the colour outside  
God made the world  
The snake tempted Eve and she died  
Wild Christian brothers sharpening their leathers  
Learn it by heart, that's the rule  
All I remember is dreading September and school  
CHORUS  
And they made me for better or worse  
The fool that I am or the wise man I'll be  
And they gave me their blessings or curse  
It wasn't their fault I was me ...  
Not the one that you see  
The priest in confession condemns my obsession  
With thoughts that I do not invite  
I mumble and stutter  
He slams down the shutter  
Goodnight - (Good night to you too, Father)  
Stainless as steel  
Lord, you know how I feel  
Someone shoot me while my soul is clear  
I don't think I'll last  
But my vow to abstain was sincere  
Arch-confraternity men to the fight  
Raise up your banners on high  
Searching for grace  
Securing my place  
When I die  
CHORUS  
Oh God, he kept a very close eye on me  
Hung round my bed in the darkness, he spied on me  
Caught me in the long grass so often, he died on me....  
Ballrooms of romance in Salthill or Mallow  
I stood like John Wayne by the wall  
Lined up like cattle, we waited to do battle and fall  
You can't wine and dine her in an old Morris Minor  
So ask her before it's too late  
I danced on girls' toes - accepted rejection as my fate  
Drink was my saviour, it made me much braver  
But I couldn't hold it too well  
I slipped on the coach and ruined my approach as I fell

A figure walks into the sunset  
Someone goes past suspended from the sky  
  
Takes more imagination  
When everything's remote control  
For me it's just a case of  
What's on the far side of the road  
  
Tell everybody  
I'm going away for ten years  
I'm going to wander  
Among the Wicklow hills  
  
The travelling children in their Sunday clothes  
Lost on the corner of the Street  
Fat gypsy lady smacks the windowpane  
A farm dog gets out on the motorway  
  
Takes more imagination  
When everything's remote control

Christy Moore,Back Home In Derry,/c/christy+moore/back+home+in+derry_21007190.html,"In 1803 we sailed out to sea  
Out from the sweet town of Derry  
For Australia bound if we didn't all drown  
And the marks of our fetters we carried  
In our rusty iron chains we cried for our weans  
Our good women we left in sorrow  
As the mainsails unfurled, our curses we hurled  
On the English, and thoughts of tomorrow  
  
At the mouth of the Foyle, bid farewell to the soil  
As down below decks we were lying  
O'Doherty screamed, woken out of a dream  
By a vision of bold Robert dying  
The sun burned cruel as we dished out the gruel  
Dan O'Connor was down with a fever  
Sixty rebels today bound for Botany Bay  
How many will meet their reciever  
  
Chorus  
Oh... I wish I was back home in Derry  
Oh... I wish I was back home in Derry  
  
I cursed them to hell as her bow fought the swell  
Our ship danced like a moth in the firelight  
White horses rode high as the devil passed by  
Taking souls to Hades by twilight  
Five weeks out to sea, we were now forty-three  
We buried our comrades each morning  
In our own slime we were lost in a time  
Of endless night without dawning  
  
Chorus  
  
Van Diemen's land is a hell for a man  
To end out his whole life in slavery  
Where the climate is raw and the gun makes the law  
Neither wind nor rain care for bravery  
Twenty years have gone by, I've ended my bond  
My comrades ghosts walk behind me  
A rebel I came - I'm still the same  
On the cold winters night you will find me

of a dolphin  
And emerges unlearned, unshamed, unharmed  
For she is the perfect creature, natural in every

And I am the geek with the alchemists stone

Christy Moore,Burning Times,/c/christy+moore/burning+times_20160789.html,"In the cool of the evening, they used to gather.  
Neath the stars in the meadow circling an old oak tree.  
At the times appointed... By the seasons...  
Of the earth and the phases of the moon.  
In the center stood a woman,  
Equal with the others and respected for her worth.  
One of the many we call the witches,  
The healers and the teachers of the wisdom of the earth.  
And the people grew through the knowledge she gave them,  
Herbs to heal their bodies, spells to make their spirits whole.  
Can't ya hear them chanting healing incantations,  
Calling forth the wise ones, celebrating in dance and song...  
(... Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali... Inanna...)  
There were those who came to power through domination.  
And they bonded in the worship of a dead man on a cross.  
They sought control of the common people  
By demanding allegiance to the church of Rome.  
And the Pope declared an inquisition  
It was war against the women, whose powers they feared.  
In this holocaust against The Nature People  
Nine million European women died.  
And the tale is told of those who by the hundreds,  
Holding together, chose their death in the sea.  
While chanting the praises of the Mother Goddess,  
A refusal of betrayal, women were dying to be free.  
(... Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali... Inanna...)  
Now the earth is a witch and the men still burn her,  
Stripping her down with mining and the poisons of their wars.  
Still to us the earth is a healer, a teacher, a mother.  
A weaver of a web of light that keeps us all alive.  
She gives us the vision to see through the chaos.  
She gives us the courage, it is our will to survive.

In the quiet of that moment,  
Our world went out of kilter.  
In that split second,  
Veronica was gone.  
  
But you will never silence her,  
Your story will be written,  
Her spirit won't rest easy,  
Until her job is done.  
With fists and boots you broke her bones,  
You gunned her down at home,  
But as soon as she was able,  
She faced you once again.  
  
You who made the phone call,  
And you who took the message down,  
You who hired the hit men,  
And you who hatched the plan,  
You who drew the money down,  
And you who paid it over,  
You who remain silent,  
You are guilty, every one.  
  
Chorus  
  
Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, warrior woman,  
Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, I offer you this song.

Chuck Berry,Aimlessly Drifting,/c/chuck+berry/aimlessly+drifting_20514600.html,"I guess I'll go to California  
Seems like I'm always on the run  
Nobody ever needs a loser  
We just exist under the sun  
But someday, somehow, someone may need me  
When my drifting days are done  
  
Well, I'm aimlessly drifting  
Looks like I live from day to day  
Hard as I try to make a showing  
Something is always in my way  
Even the one I truly love now  
Deals in the games that people play  
  
Every time I love I always lose  
Seems like I'll never ever win  
Each I hear them lonesome blues  
I'm all alone at home again  
Seems like I'm just existing  
Aimlessly drifting to no end  
  
All that I ask of this old world  
Is just to have a happy home  
All that I ask of one little girl  
Is just to be my very own  
It seems just like I'm just existing  
Aimlessly drifting along  
  
Yes, I'll go to California  
Seems like I'm always on the run  
Nobody ever needs a loser  
I just exist under the sun  
But someday, somehow, someone may need me  
But my drifting days be done

I got to go, push my pirough way down the bayou  
They got a band up on the stand and a beautiful light show  
Au revoir, Jean, dig the show from up on the plateau  
In my pirough, with my Bordeaux, out on the bayou  
Creeping along, singing a song, see'est, see'est bon, bon  
Playing the music on my acoustic Spanish guitaro  
Having a duet with my coquette out on the bayou  
It's growing night, we've got no lights out on the bayou  
Beautiful trip, think we'll sip some of my Bordeaux  
Two more miles going wild to play my acoustic  
See them stand to clap their hands to hear my music  
One more mile, we rested awhile and sipped on some Bordeaux  
While we's grooving, a fog was moving in on the bayou  
On my knee, just couldn't see the front of my pirough  
We didn't mind, we just reclined and sipped some more Bordeaux  
Ay-ay, Jean, I missed the show up on the plateau  
Si vous plait, push my pirough back up the bayou  
No see the band, no see the stand, no see the light show  
Ahh, Jean, we had a show out on the bayou

Chuck Berry,Bound To Lose,/c/chuck+berry/bound+to+lose_20514597.html,"Looks like I'll go on through my life bound in sorrow  
I'm a loser right from the start  
Now I've lost the only one I really loved  
And I'm bound to this pain in my heart  
I am bound because I am so much in love with you  
And I know that this love's all in vain  
When you let anyone have the love you say is mine  
It proves to me I'm a loser again  
I am bound with so many sweet memories of you  
What more can a poor loser do ?  
I can't change your ways, I can't make you love me more  
I am bound to this crave I have for you  
I was bound to lose you when I first fell in love with you  
I thought I'd try and love again  
Oh, I lost, but kept my chin up and I would pull through every time  
But losing you has laid my head in my hands

It's not too far back off the highway, not so long a ride  
You park your car out in the open, you can walk inside  
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her, ma'am

Hold tight, pat your foot, don't let 'em carry it away  
Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud

He wanted to play rock music and sing some songs of joy  
When he started school, he just could pat his feet  
The first song he ever learned had a strong boogie beat  
Come on now  
Rock it, rock it, rock it along  
Roll it, roll it, roll it on  
Git it, git it, git it on  
Got it, got it, got it and gone  
Then one day it happened, they hauled him off to war  
Way over there in no man's land, just him and his guitar  
Nobody near to love him, nobody ever sent him news  
What could a poor boy do at night, but to sit down and sing them blues  
Early one morning they called him, oh, what a beautiful day  
They packed him in an old army plane and flew him back home to stay  
He landed in Clark Air base, but didn't have no place to go  
So he sit down with his guitar in the middle of the street and gave everybody
a free show.

And, at the birthday parties, when he'd shed a happy tear  
Thinking of the wedding dress that she would wear someday  
When he'd have to give his daughter Caroline away  
He thought of what he saw the night they called her from the roll  
A silver graduation ring and engagement ring of gold  
It seems as tho' twas yesterday he met her valentine  
And now she's grown and here to wed his daughter Caroline  
Maarching on his arm she whispered, ""Pa, I still love you""  
Those words remained within his ears when she vowed, ""I do""  
Cheer was sparkling from his eyes, but tears were in behind  
When he gave his heart away, his daughter Caroline

'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me  
I went down in Mississippi, I asked Mister Charlie about my roots  
He said, ""Turn around, bend over, boy, they're right here in my boots""  
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me  
I asked a policeman the time, he swung and crowned me with his stock  
I managed to walk away so glad it weren't twelve o'clock  
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me  
My girl friend's datin' this here guy who's goin' out with some man's wife  
I lost my girl, the wife her husband, the guy he lost his life  
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me  
I used to have a Ford Torino and at that time I had a chick  
She used to get her kicks just askin' me to flick my Bic  
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me  
My grandpa drove a horse and buggy but my father used the train  
I worked and bought a Cadillac but my son, he drives a plane  
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be  
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me

Chuck Berry,If I Were,/c/chuck+berry/if+i+were_20514579.html,"If I were a pendulum swing and you were the bird in the cuckoo clock  
Ev'ry time you cucko-cooed I would double tick another tick tock  
I'd double my swing ev'ry time you'd sing we'd make good time with each other  
Oh, but that would be just so much fun cooin' and swingin' together  
If I were a little bitty boy and I had just a little bit o' credit  
I would make a loan for an ice cream cone and I'd go right away and get it  
You would lick a little and I would lick a little, we surely could lick with
each other  
Oh, but that would be just so much fun, eating it all together  
And if I were a little honey bee and you were a little butterfly  
I would be waiting at the garden gate until you came fluttering by  
Maybe you'd stop on a red rose top and then we could talk to each other  
Oh, but we cou'd flutter up so much fun being in the garden together  
But I'm just an ordinary guy and I love all the things you do  
You seem such a talented, beautiful girl and I'm afraid to even talk to you  
If I were as bold like some guys, hearin' them talk to each other  
I'd come over and ask you if we could go out together  
But if you were a Mercedes-Benz, I'd have to be a Fleetwood Brougham  
And ev'ry time I saw you rollin' on the freeway I think I'd have to follow you
home  
You could let me lodge in your double garage, bumper to bumper out of the
weather  
Nobody home but the Benz and the Brougham, really rarin' to roll off together

Seems everyone I meet  
Gives me a friendly Hello!  
Guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
Birds in every tree  
Seem all so near to me  
They sing wherever I go  
Guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
[Chorus]  
If you should ask me the amount  
In my bank account  
I would have to confess  
That I'm slipping  
But, that don't worry me  
Confidentially, I got a dream that I'm tip in  
  
And when the days through  
Each night, I hurry to  
Home where love ways I know  
Guess, I'm just a lucky so and so

Each night, I hurry to

Chuck Berry,I'm Just A Name,/c/chuck+berry/im+just+a+name_20514587.html,"Hello, I'm just a fan who had to call you on the phone  
Someone you won't remember of the many that you own  
I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone  
Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown  
I know I'm only someone else in love with you in vain  
I wish I could have helped myself, but love is so much pain  
It makes me feel that there is still a chance that may remain  
That you will someday surely come and give me love again  
I knew your love would never be as deep as mine for you  
And I knew that these many nights I'd be alone and blue  
And lie awake while you forsake the only love I knew  
And never learn that you'll return and we would live it through  
Each time I dream a dream, I dream we're cuddled arm in arm  
It seems you're looking straight at me, when I see you perform  
Sometimes I think you see my face become so shy and warm  
I often wonder if you know the power in your charms  
Please, let me say I still love you before you hang the phone  
And I am proud to once have shared the beauty that you own  
I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone  
Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown

She's ready, waitin' for me under the front porch light  
She said, ""Ain't it dark out there, ooh, it's so dark out there  
I hope your car got bright lights, ooh, it's so dark out there""  
  
We went to a house party, it was really outta sight  
It was about forty people dancin' under one dim light  
""Ain't it dark in there, ooh, it's too dark in there  
Will you take me somewhere else, darlin', 'cause it's too dark in there""  
  
So I drove her out the freeway into the country air  
She said, ""I hope you ain't gonna park around here nowhere  
It's too dark out there, so dark out there  
Let's go back into town and do something 'cause it's too dark out there""  
  
So I asked her just where she had in mind to go  
She said, ""Maybe to a scary movie picture show""  
I said, ""It's too dark in there""  
I said, ""It's too dark in there  
I've seen that movie before, baby, it's too dark in there""  
  
So it was nothing left for me to do but take her back home  
'Twas no one there, the lights was out and the fuse was blown  
And it was dark in there, yes, it was dark in there  
And we finally got the fuse in  
Ooh, it was dark in there

Wondering where on earth you were and what you might be doing  
But I've changed, nothing like I used to be  
When I cared so much for you was love blinded and I couldn't see  
I have waited for you at morning, right behind a sleepless night  
But now my eyes are wide open and I see you wasn't right  
Yes, I've changed, nothing like I used to be  
When I cared so much for you, I was love blinded and I couldn't see

Chuck Berry,Jaguar And Thunderbird,/c/chuck+berry/jaguar+thunderbird_20224097.html,"Chorus: Slow down, little Jaguar  
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford  
Ten miles stretch on an Indiana road  
T'was a sky blue Jaguar and a Thunderbird Ford  
Jaguar setting on ninety nine  
Tryin' to beat the Bird to the county line  
Just a half-a-mile from Newtonville  
There had a speed sign sitting at the top of the hill  
It said : ""35 miles, and stay in line""  
But the Jaguar and Thunderbird never read the sign  
Chorus  
Ludenville was a real small town  
Had a hundred and two  
And nine acres of ground  
Some stool pigeon put the sheriff wise  
Told him ""Park down in Newtonville  
And catch 'em guys""  
Sheriff laid down, half hid in the weeds  
Parked for eight days, didn't nobody speed  
All of a sudden, dust rose on the road  
Said ""Here come the Jaguar and Thunderbird Ford""  
Chorus  
Sheriff doubled clutched second, put it in third  
Took right after the Jaguar and Thunderbird  
He knew he'd get a bonus and a big fat fine  
If he caught 'em 'fore they crossed that county line  
Sheriff never drove his car a hundred and flat  
But if he aimed to get 'em  
He'd have to do more than that  
Crest of the hill, he's about a mile behind  
There wasn't but two mor miles to the county line  
Chorus  
Old Sheiff was countin' on the downward grade  
With the tall wind pushin', he had it made  
Thunderbird saw the Jaguar gainin' speed  
And waved ""Goodbye, Jaguar"" and pulled in the lead  
Jaguar said ""You ain't won the race yet""  
And pulled back around the Bird like a sabre jet  
Sheriff's front bumper was a yard behind  
When the T-Bird, Jaguar crossed the line  
Slow down little Jaguar,  
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford  
(repeat and fade)

And the sun shines brightly on the mountaintop,  
I took a trip on a sailing ship,  
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop.  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.  
  
Down at the market you can hear,  
All the ladies cry out while on their heads they bear,  
Akie rice, salt fish are nice,  
And the sun is fine any time of the year.  
  
[CHORUS  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.]  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere,  
And the children sway to and fro,  
I must declare that my heart is there,  
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico.

But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,

Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,/c/chuck+berry/jo+jo+gunne_20224368.html,"It was in ancient history, four thousand B.C.  
Back up in the jungle in a coconut tree  
Hanging on a branch up under the sun  
Was a meddlesome monkey named Jo Jo Gunne  
Old Leo the lion came down from the mountain  
To get a drink of water from the jungle fountain  
Jo Jo the monkey started tellin' him jive  
About the elephant who was gonna skin him alive  
Leo tried to reach and grab Jo Jo's tail  
Got mad and went roarin' through the jungle trail  
He ran upon an elephant beneath a tree  
And said, put up your dukes you gotta tussle with me  
An ol' eagle from Asia made a non stop flight  
Tryin' to make it in time, just to see them fight  
A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge  
Coming all the way from India on a local barge  
Ol' gorilla heard 'em talking in the lion's den  
But Jo Jo bet him three bucks the elephant wins  
Jo Jo yelled at Leo, Go on, knock him down  
He don't outweigh you but a thousand pounds  
Leo left wailin' with a left upper cut  
The elephant took his snoot and grabbed a coconut  
Leo fired a beautiful short back cross  
That's when the coconut landed up against his jaw  
Leo grew tired, but he wouldn't give in  
The elephant all loose, beat his jawbone in  
The buzzard said, they fought furious all day  
He couldn't understand how Leo got away  
Jo Jo runnin' everywhere, spreadin' the news  
To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos  
A hoot owl reported everything he saw  
Had his eyes wide open, they called it a draw  
Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised  
Jo Jo in the trees started singin' the blues  
Laughin', meddling, jumpin' up and down  
Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground  
Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat  
Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet  
Jo Jo was screamin' with tears in his eyes  
Said, please mister Leo, I apologize  
Said, if you let my feet upon solid ground  
I'll fight you close range, fifteen rounds  
Leo got back to the square of the fight  
Jo Jo took a leap and jumped... out of sight

Chuck Berry,Lonely School Days,/c/chuck+berry/lonely+school+days_20514572.html,"I saw you when you came in this morning  
All chummy with somebody new  
And I was all alone this morning  
In sorrrow still loving you  
I know it shows, I'm broken hearted  
This feelin' just won't go away  
I've been so lonesome since we parted  
And I'll be blue again in school today  
Lonely school days do I have when you  
Come to school with someone new  
In my deepest sorrow over losing you  
Lonely school days keep me blue  
I saw you eating in the lunch room  
Right where we used to sit and dine  
With someone snugged up close beside you  
Enjoying pleasures that were mine  
You talk to them along the hallways  
You walk with them to classes too  
You leave and go with them of evenings  
And I go home alone and blue

Chuck Berry,Louis To Frisco,/c/chuck+berry/louis+to+frisco_20514571.html,"I'm as free as a bird now  
As flighty as a Bumble Bee  
I'm here today and gone tomorrow  
Foot loose child and fancy free  
I'm absolutely independent  
Nothin' at all is gonna worry me  
I believe I was born to travel  
The open road is gonna bring me close  
You come to know some way-out people  
To say the least, I dig the most  
Who live and love across both borders  
Trip, East and West from coast to coast  
I only have one cradle to rock now  
I'm gonna rock it everywhere I go  
From St. Louis to San Francisco  
Ah! From Canada to Mexico  
I'm gonna let my cradle rock now  
'Till it just won't rock no more

That I'd meet my true love and take her away  
She said I'd be happy and to be good and true  
I'd never be lonely, broken hearted or blue  
  
Ma' dear, Ma' dear, just like you said  
I met my true love one and we are to wed  
Ma' dear, she's an angel and I'm goin' to be true  
Or else I may lose her, I don't want to lose her to somebody new  
  
Ma' dear, Ma' dear, I was not untrue  
I tried hard to please her, but she's gone and I'm blue  
Ma' dear, I'm so lonesome, broken hearted, too

Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
As I was motivatin' over the hill  
I saw Maybellene in a coup de ville.  
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road,  
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford.  
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five,  
She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
Pink in the mirror on top of the hill,  
It's just like swallowin' up a medicine pill.  
First thing I saw that Cadillac grille  
Doin' a hundred and ten gallopin' over that hill.  
Offhill curve, a downhill stretch,  
Me and that Cadillac neck by neck.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford,  
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more.  
It then got clody and it started to rain,  
I tooted my horn for a passin' lead  
The rain water blowin' all under my hood,  
I knew that was doin' my motor good.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.  
  
The motor cooled down, the heat went down  
And that's when I heard that highway sound.  
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead  
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead.  
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still  
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill.  
  
Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?  
You've started back doing the things you used to do.

Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me  
She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call  
'Cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall  
  
Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie  
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis Tennessee  
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge  
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge  
  
Help me, information, more than that I cannot add  
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had  
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree  
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee  
  
Last time I saw Marie she's waving me good-bye  
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye  
Marie is only six years old, information please  
Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee

Drove for the curb, raised up the hood  
Couldn't see nothing wrong, line o' cars long  
Traffic bogged down, tryin' to drive around  
Officer Lamar, walkin' toward the car:  
""Move it!"", ""Come along move it"",  
""You cannot stop it here, now move it"", ""Move it""  
""Get out of there, move it""  
Three and two the count, bases loaded down  
Slugger at the plate, known to hit 'em straight  
Tension from the fans, shoutin' in the stands  
Signal from the catch, pitcher's in the stretch  
Bat 'n' ball crack, pitcher's backin' back:  
""Move it!"", ""Move it!"", ""Get along, move it!""  
""The ball is droppin' past, now"" ""Move it!""  
""Let the ball, now, let's go home, now, move it!""  
  
She drives a Mustang, she lets her hair hang  
She dresses like a fish, makes you look and wish  
Puts you in a trance, body built to dance  
Disco queen, twistin' in between  
Play a super song, watch her get it on  
Pretty, wow!  
""Get hip, move it!"" ""Move it""

Have a little cake and a bit o' coke now and do the things we used to do  
  
Jingle bells will all be ringing and little kids' eyes all aglow  
Children strolling, singing carols, makin' tracks out in the snow  
Oh, but I'll be with you this Christmas, maybe yes and maybe no  
  
Christmas time is really joyful, oh, but it's a lonely season, too  
Many people are so cheerful and some are alone and blue  
What would make my Christmas happy if I could have it all alone with you

I wanna tell you I still love you and how it feels to be alone  
Wanna wish you a merry Christmas as the old year passes on.

My grandma bought me a cute little toy  
Two silver bells on a string  
She told me it was my ding-a-ling-a-ling  
  
My ding-a-ling my ding-a-ling won't you play with my ding-a-ling  
My ding-a-ling my ding-a-ling won't you play with my ding-a-ling  
  
When I was little boy in grammar school  
Always went by the very best rule  
But every time the bell would ring  
You'd catch me playing with my ding-a-ling  
  
Once while climbing the garden wall,  
Slipped and fell had a very bad fall  
I fell so hard I heard birds sing,  
But I held on to my ding-a-ling  
  
Once while swimming cross turtle creek  
Man them snappers right at my feet  
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing  
With both hands holding my ding-a-ling  
  
Now this here song it ain't so bad  
Prettiest little song that you ever had  
And those of you who will not sing  
Must be playing with your on ding-a-ling

Yesterday, she came to me and held my hand  
Said she was blue and oh so lonesome  
And would I try to understand  
I didn't know till this morning  
How much my woman means to me  
This morning when I got home, she was not there  
I noticed her clothes were gone  
And a little note lay on my shelf  
Said as you read this, I love you still  
But I'll be gone, I don't know where  
Today I got the blues and I got 'em bad  
Last night as I lay sleeping  
My conscious will not go to rest  
Yesterday I lost the best woman I ever had  
One of these days, can't say where and I don't know when  
It may be in time, it may be soon  
It may be in a place I've never been  
But I'm gonna find that fine woman  
And together with her again

I think I see her please let me off this bus  
  
Nadine, honey is that you?  
Oh, Nadine. Honey, is that you?  
Seems like every time I see you Darling you got something else to do  
  
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back  
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored cadillac  
I was pushin' through the crowd to get to where she's at  
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat  
  
Downtown searching for her, looking all around.  
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town.  
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab.  
With a twenty dollar bill, told him 'catch that yellow cab.'  
  
She move around like a wave of summer breeze,  
Go, driver, go, go, catch her balmy breeze.  
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier.  
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear.

And I pulled in the drive

Then I walked inside  
Dealer came to me  
Said ""Trade in you Ford  
And I'll put you in a car  
That'll eat up the road  
Just tell me what you want  
And then sign on that line  
And I'll have it brought down to you

And I'll be headed on down the road  
Then I won't have to worry  
About that broken - down, raggedy Ford
