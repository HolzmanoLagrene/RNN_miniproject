I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself

You'll never even get me out on the floor  
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Won't go to hear them play a tango  
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul  
There's only one sure way to get me to go  
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll  
Call me a relic, call me what you will  
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill  
Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll

I like the Old time Rock 'n' Rock

When all you see is seen through tears  
The whole world seems as though it's crying  
Rain eyes, that's how my world appears  
One sunny day in Lou'siana  
The clouds began to hover low  
And darkness came in early evening  
And brought a rain that would not go  
I's just a child when mother told me  
It seems your father's gone away  
It's not his fault, my child, forgive him  
I should have known he would not stay  
You're so much like him and he loves you  
But now his love's for only you  
Although he forced himself to leave you  
Forgiving me he could not do  
Rain eyes that cloud the hope of sunshine  
When everything is seen through tears  
The whole world seems as though it's crying  
Rain eyes, that's how my world appears  
It rains all evening into nighttime  
Then rains all night and through the day  
My mother's eyes are weak from crying  
Forgive her, she just lost her way  
Since you've been gone her eyes have clouded  
And darkness reigns her weary view  
She'd see again from your returning  
That God knows she's in love with you  
One rainy day in Louisiana  
The trade winds blew the clouds away  
A mother heard her boy shout, ""Father""  
My God, 'tis him, he's come to stay

Close up your books, get out of your seat

You have to be with her when she's alone  
She could say no and then want you to leave her  
And call you right back home after you're gone  
  
You never can tell until after you've tried her  
And then you might still be way off the track  
Because it's the red and the white and the yellow  
Has exactly what's packed in the black  
  
One was a co-ed from Pennsylvania  
One from Toronto who dug him the most  
One was a rich widow in Houston  
And one was a freak from the western coast  
  
One was a teacher out of Chicago  
And one had plans to become a nun  
And one was the last one I thought he'd cling to  
But she was tahe one who gave him a son  
  
So people, I'll tell you 'bout my buddy  
And like I say, I just can't reveal his name  
It's his life and he's gonna live it

I've had to worry my life along  
But someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
  
How many times, how many times since you went away  
Have I set and cried and cried both night and day  
Someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
  
You're on my mind, baby, every place I go  
How much I love you, nobody knows  
But someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Bye-bye, baby, I don't care what you do

I'll lay 'em down as fast as you can pick 'em up  
It wudn't me, it wudn't me  
I'm so glad it wudn't me  
Just meters from a canine jubilee  
Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me  
He reached a highway through the ticket on the side  
And a trucker came along and let him ride  
But as he settled down to thank him for no harm  
He saw a swasti-KKK band on his arm  
That's when he knew he had to get on help his self  
'Stead if sittin' pinnin' it on somebody else  
He hung a left into that thicket 'cross the fence  
And ain't nobody ever sawed or seen him since  
It wudn't me, it wudn't me  
I'm so glad it wudn't me  
It ain't quite my kinda cup o'tea

You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle  
And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell,

They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale  
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale,

Seven hundred little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz

Christmas is all about caring  
And as every princess knows  
Nothing is quiet as warming  
When it's storming or it snows  
  
So, I'm giving love for Christmas  
The best gift that I can give  
And in these times we live  
It seems more and more, what we're looking for  
  
Christmas is being with family  
Seeing all the friends you've missed  
Making new Christmas memories  
That's the first thing on my Christmas list  
  
I'd give you everything  
If I had everything, it's true  
But all that I have is my heart to give  
So that's what I'm giving you  
  
I'm giving love for Christmas  
And hoping that you will too

And hoping that if you do  
It just might be me, you give your love to

Beaten every step of the way  
Lived by the glass

Kept my momma walking the floor

Who dealt a dirty hand  
Promised we could touch the sky  
But the devil's his friend

And I feel lucky that my eyes could see  
People standing up and being  
Who they want to be  
People made the music  
And the music may them free  
  
Now I was just a baby through  
The summer of love they say  
But it still feels like it was yesterday  
And if the road gets rough  
I pick up my guitar and play  
  
It's always been right by my side  
To help me on my way  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow  
Ain't anticipating what's to come  
And I don't need to worry 'bout  
The things I have not done  
Long as I got rock and roll  
I'm forever young  
  
Now we can't always understand this world  
Farther along we'll understand it all  
The '70s looked like we all  
Were headed for a fall  
But those who listened hard enough  
Could hear the summer call  
  
Now I was growing up through all of this  
My first beer and love and my first kiss  
You never learn the things in school  
You learn by living and going through  
You taught me to be myself  
How can I thank you

treating his best friend's wife  
Tipper lead the war against the record industry  
She said she saw the devil on her MTV

It takes more than a key  
Just like Jimmy's skeletons  
And his ministry

Just a little helper to get us by  
We all need a little shelter  
Just a little helper ooo, and it'll be alright  
  
Hit it now  
  
For some it's the needle  
For some it's the kill  
Some people wave the Bible  
'Cause it's giving them a thrill  
You can spend your money  
Before you get your pay  
With a toss of the dice  
You can piss it all away  
  
We all need a little shelter  
Just a little helper to get us by  
We all need a little shelter  
Just a little helper ooo, and it'll be alright

Cinderella,Sick For The Cure,/c/cinderella/sick+for+the+cure_20031372.html,"There used to be a time when I thought I had the answers  
Answers to the questions that nobody knew  
Used to be a time when I had some time  
But when I had the time, I didn't know what to do  
Wasted all those years never gettin? any younger  
Times kept a changin? but I still got the hunger  
Only trouble is the walls are closing in  
Sometimes I want to give it all away  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then I'm never comin' back again  
Maybe I?ll head down south to New Orleans  
Wouldn't have no taxes ?cause I wouldn't have no means  
Lookin' for a Genie that could fill my dreams  
But dreams become reality and real ain't what it seems to be  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then I'm never comin' back again  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then I'm never comin' back again  
Sick for the cure on this roller coaster ride  
It can take you real low and it can get you real high  
Just passin? time  
But time ain't on our side  
Ah, guitar  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then I'm never comin' back again  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then I'm never comin' back again  
I just wanna be free  
Free like the wind  
And if the wind fills my sails  
Then I'm never comin' back again, alright

You drift until you brutalize  
You made your first kill now

I followed him through hard jungles  
As he stalked through the back lots  
Strangling through the night shades  
  
The thief of life  
Moved onwards and outwards to love  
  
In a one stop only motel  
A storm bangs on the cheapest room  
The phantom slips in to spill blood  
Even on the sweetest honeymoon  
  
The killer of love  
Caught the last late Niagara bus  
  
By chance or escaping from misery  
By suddenness or in answer to pain  
Smoking in the dark cinema  
You could see the bad go down again  
  
And the clouds are high in Spanish mountains  
And a Ford roars through the night full of rain.  
  
The killer's blood flows  
But he loads his gun again  
  
Make a grown man cry like a girl  
To see the guns dying at sunset  
  
In vain lovers claimed  
But they never had met.

A man who stood up against the scum, the filth.

At the foot of the pillar of the road  
Propped inside was an old man  
Whom time would not erode  
When the night was snapped by sirens  
Those blue lights circled fast  
The dance hall called for an' ambulance  
The bars all closed up fast  
  
My silence gazing at the ceiling  
While roaming the single room  
I thought the old man could help me  
If he could explain the gloom  
You really think it's all new  
You really think about it too  
The old man coffed as he spoke to me

But not the sorrow afterwards  
With my father dead and my mother ran off  
My brothers took the pay of hoods  
The twenties turned the north was dead  
The hunger strike came marching south  
At the garden party not a word was said  
The ladies lifted cake to their mouths  
  
The next war began and my ship sailed  
With battle orders writ'n in red  
In five long years of bullets and shells  
We left ten million dead  
The few returned to old Piccadilly  
We limped around Leicester Square  
The world was busy rebuilding itself  
The architects could not care  
  
But how could we know when I was young  
All the changes that were to come?  
All the photos in the wallets on the battlefield  
And now the terror of the scientific sun  
There was masters an' servants an' servants an' dogs  
They taught you how to touch your cap  
But through strikes an' famine an' war an' peace  
England never closed this gap  
  
So leave me now the moon is up  
But remember all the tales I tell  
The memories that you have dragged up  
Are on letters forwarded from hell  
  
The streets were by now deserted  
The gangs had trudged off home  
The lights clicked off in the bedsits  
An' old England was all alone

Down in the bunkers in the crust of the earth

Scanning the wild wind  
Blowing through the Berlin corridor

Shaking with the mystery tears

New York, New York, New York, 42nd Street  
Hustlers rustle and pimps pimp the beat  
Monty Clift is recognized at dawn  
He ain't got no shoes and his clothes are torn  
  
I see a car smashed at night  
Cut the applause and dim the light  
Monty's face is broken on a wheel  
Is he alive? Can he still feel?  
  
Nembutol numbs it all  
But I prefer alcohol  
  
He said go out and get me my old movie stills  
Go out and get me another roll of pills  
There I go again shaking, but I ain't got the chills  
  
ARRRGHHHGORRA BUH BHUH DO ARRRRGGGGHHHHNNNN!!!!

Wash away sin city  
They say it was written  
In the page of the Lord  
  
But I was looking  
For that great jazz note  
That destroyed  
The walls of Jericho  
  
The winds of fear  
Whip away the sickness  
The messages on the tablet  
Was valium  
  
As the planets form  
That golden cross Lord  
I'll see you on  
The holy cross roads  
  
After all this time  
To believe in Jesus  
After all those drugs  
I thought I was Him  
After all my lying  
And a-crying  
And my suffering  
I ain't good enough  
I ain't clean enough  
To be Him  
  
The tribal wars  
Burning up the homeland  
The fuel of evil  
Is raining from the sky  
The sea of lava  
Flowing down the mountain  
The time will sleep  
Us sinners by  
  
Holy rollers roll  
Give generously now  
Pass the hubcap please  
Thank you Lord

Like a man about to burst  
I was dying of thirst  
  
Though I will never fade  
Or get lost in this daze  
Though I will disappear  
Into the street parade  
  
It's not too hard to cry  
In these crying times  
I'll take a broken heart  
And take it home in parts  
But I will never fade  
  
I was in this place  
By the first church of the city  
I saw tears on the face  
The face of a visionary  
  
Though I will disappear  
To join the street parade  
Disappear and fade  
Into the street parade

This is England  
This is how we feel  
  
Time on his hands freezing in those clothes  
He won't go for the carrot  
They beat him by the pole  
Some sunny day confronted by his soul  
He's out at sea, too far off, he can't go home  
  
This is England  
What we're supposed to die for  
This is England  
And we're never gonna cry no more

Falls on a Triumph line  
I got my motorcycle jacket  
But I'm walking all the time  
South Atlantic wind blows  
Ice from a dying creed  
I see no glory  
When will we be free

We can chain you to the rail  
This is England  
We can kill you in a jail

Got 'em in the head

Who cares to protest  
A (???) in the eye like a flare  
Out came the batons and  
The British warned themselves

You can watch from the debris, the last bedroom light

clerks who bear no guilt

A bang on the door resoundingly clear

The demon at the story''s heart  
The cuckoo in the nest  
Gives so little of himself away  
Which is the reason why you will stay

By whom or what possessed

These are the names in the case

His motives - they''re all news  
No shortage of detractors  
To air their noisy views  
The man inspires a thousand lies  
The lover takes his choice  
Remaining coldly in control  
Aware that sadly, on the whole  
It is the fool who bares his soul
