When the child became a man  
Saw my future in the making - saw the path my life was taking  
You saw a million things I'll never understand  
  
You know me better than I know myself  
Better than I know myself  
Time after time you've shown it to be true  
That no one loves me like you  
  
You are here so let it rain or let it shine  
You are with me all the time  
When I'm waking - when I'm sleeping  
In the secret thoughts I'm keeping  
  
You know everything about this heart of mine  
You know me better than I know myself  
Better than I know myself  
Time after time you've shown it to be true  
  
That no one loves me like you  
You'll be there - when the end of time has come  
And I know you'll take me home  
So I thank you for tomorrow  
  
All my joys and all my sorrows  
And I thank you for the greatest thing I've known  
You know me better than I know myself  
Better than I know myself  
  
Time after time you've shown it to be true  
That no one loves me like you

Don't you feel no shame  
Look what you've done!  
Now she's just a broken girl while you're  
All around the world - having your fun  
She had you in her heart  
You made a fool of her right from the very start  
She thought she'd paid her fare  
Now you've gone and you just don't care

Talk about the reason and the rhyme.  
Talk about the sentimental feelings,  
Talk about the candlelight and wine,  
Talk about the children.  
Listen to the voices singing.  
Listen to the laughter as they play  
But listen to the whisper of a heartbeat  
Whose loneliness is never far away.  
(chorus)  
In some hearts it's never christmas,  
But it's winter all the time.  
All our lives spent waiting for the sun,  
Children of tomorrow,  
How they need a star to follow.  
In some hearts it's always winter,  
For some hearts it seems,  
That christmas never comes.  
Don't forget the winter's children,  
Shadows on a star that never shines.  
Looking for the love that never happened  
Looking for the chris in christmas time.  
The lonely voice,  
That can't rejoice,  
That has no choice.

In some hearts it's never christmas,

With no one left to beat  
There's still a fading desire  
To burn a naked light  
Just to defy the night  
  
Come on and call me a liar  
A crumble tumble down  
In fumble bumble town  
Our lives a ruin  
We reconstruct a bit  
And pretty up a bit  
We hardly know what we're doing

But me and my baby  
Make the best of this world  
She's like a diamond  
Innocent girl  
We watch the sign of the times  
Writing on the wall, cities may fall  
  
Back through the city fog  
I was another cog  
For the machinery there  
Now the machines have gone  
The silence hanging on  
I sit, I stare  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Come on and take your aim  
I feel the mildest pain  
Protecting something so rare  
'Cause there's a gem or two  
Inside the human zoo  
If only you are aware

Crawling from here to Memphis  
Knocked senseless, like  
Digging a hole to china to find

I come home  
Watch it on the news who else was overthrown

As hard as I try  
But I keep crossing over the great divide  
And it's like  
  
Climbing up mount everest

So you're no longer near to me  
But my heart sees you there with me  
Every sunset you share with me  
  
The rain that patters through the trees reminds  
Me of you constantly  
Your name is whispered by the breeze and love birds  
Bring your song to me  
  
Just as sure as the stars keep burning  
In the sky your love will stay a flame in me  
A flame that burns so bright  
Not only through the night  
But constantly  
  
Just as sure as each star keeps burning  
In the sky your love will stay a flame in me  
A flame that burns so bright  
Not only through the night  
But constantly  
  
Though we may be far apart  
You're constantly deep in my heart

Oh won't somebody tell me where?  
Cause it used to be when I was young  
That you could hear them playing it everywhere  
But now it seems they're all so hooked on fashion  
The music's taken second place  
Everyone it seems has one obsession  
To beat the others in the race  
And it just don't feel right to me  
No no it just don't feel right to me  
  
Cause I love that Rock'n'roll too much  
And I don't wanna see it ever waving goodbye  
Yeah I love that Rock'n'roll too too much  
And I couldn't bear to see it go by  
Rock'n'roll you're too much to deny  
  
Oh where has all that music gone  
There must be some mistake  
From something that was so much fun  
They were burning bridges in their wake  
O. K. Everything has got to keep changing  
I know it has to be that way  
But isn't it too high a price we're paying  
We're losing most of yesterday  
And it just don't feel right to me

Showing the future, the past  
Same cat with them evil eyes  
And I knew it was a spell she'd cast.

She's gonna get you from behind.  
  
Give me the ring on your finger  
Let me see the lines of your hand  
I can see me a tall dark stranger  
Giving you what you hadn't planned  
I drank the potion she offered me  
I found myself on the floor  
Then I looked in those big green eyes  
And I wondered what I came there for.

Stay awake  
Look out  
If you're out on a moonlit night  
Be careful of the neighborhood strays  
Of a lady with long black hair  
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways  
Crystal ball on the table  
Showing the future, the past  
Same cat with them evil eyes  
You'd better get out of there fast  
She's just a devil woman  
With evil on her mind  
Beware the devil woman  
She's gonna get you.

Cliff Richard,Good On The Sally Army,/c/cliff+richard/good+on+the+sally+army_20513891.html,"Sunday finds me curled in bed  
I can hear the Sally Army in the old town square  
I can hear their brass and chorus's, they fill the air  
And I wonder why they do it when there's no-one ever there  
Moments later, out of bed goes me and I'm gazing out the window in the morning
light  
And the lasses in their bonnets makes a pretty sight  
And I thought if that's an army, it's a funny way to fight  
But its an empty life if you've got no purpose  
And your lost and feel your on your own  
And if I told my work mates, they'd have said I'd gone barmy  
When I ran down the stair to join the Salvation Army  
Oh it was love that I could depend upon  
And all of my emptiness had gone  
Babababbababababa  
Oh it's an empty life if you've got no purpose  
And your lost and feel your on your own  
If I told my work mates, they'd have said I'd gone barmy  
When I ran down the stair to join the Salvation Army  
Oh it was love that I could depend upon  
And all of my emptiness had gone  
Some years later, looking back at me  
I believe I've found the answer and I'd like to say  
You've need never be alone when God's a prayer away  
And He'll fill you with his sunshine if your life is cold and grey

In Liverpool, in squalor cast adrift  
A dirty ragged mess of desperation  
Though devil touched, I took as God's gift  
No history, no owner, no rhyme, no reason  
Nor explanation of his sorry state  
And all the fire of the survivor  
I couldn't leave it, I couldn't leave it to it's fate

Dirty, ragged, coloured breed  
Welcome it with open arms  
Welcome one more mouth to feed  
Could your own blood not provide you  
With the gratitude you need?  
We will call the boy, Heathcliff  
And every man on earth conceals a secret  
On which he feeds and yet tears him apart  
And in this child so great that complication  
Will surely destroy the strongest heart  
And as you fall into the traps, he sets you  
And as you're drawn to cross his reckless line  
And as I watch you peer into his darkness  
I pray you'll never search, I pray you'll never search for mine  
What are we to do with it?  
Dirty, ragged, coloured breed  
Welcome it with open arms  
Welcome one more mouth to feed

Everything is so temporary  
Ooh those I'll let you know eyes

I'm the man who's left behind  
I must have been blind  
Must have been  
  
I-I needed understanding  
Ooh-ooh you didn't symphathise  
Left me here-left without a warning  
Ooh you left me paralysed  
I-I should have realized  
  
I'm no hero  
I won't get the glory  
I'm the one who's left behind  
I'm no hero  
No place in your story  
I'm the man who's left behind

Down in the deep blue sea  
I'm gonna look in the forest

And if you find a funny face in your comic book  
Baby it'll be me I'll be lookin' for you

I'm gonna look in the cities  
Where the lights are blue  
Gonna search the country side  
And the haystacks too  
  
Well if you see something shootin' out across the stars  
If you see a rocket ship in it's way to Mars

Underneath the ground  
  
Brother Luke he turned away  
And uncle john refused to stay

He'll see another day

But now they don't speak anymore  
So he walks the streets, the few nights he can stand  
Drinking her memory away when he can  
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore  
  
But now they don't cry anymore  
How does it all come to happen  
That's not what loving is for  
And if i thought it was,i would leave here in the morning  
I'd sooner sleep on the floor  
  
Oh when will we learn really what loving is  
It's not what you get in return but what you give

Lie the jewels that I obey  
Summer warm winds  
That embrace me

Buys the pride I'd rather sell

Are wasted affair

How to cut the thread  
And leave it all behind  
Looking windward for my comfort  
I take each day as it arrives

Lay down all thoughts of your surrender  
It's only me who's killing time  
Lay down all dreams and themes once remembered  
It's just the same

And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine I'll keep  
Ocean deep  
  
Now, can't you hear when I call  
Can't you hear a word I say  
A little love is all I ask  
A little feelin' when we touch  
  
Why am I still alone  
I've got a heart without a home  
A little love is all I ask  
And that is all  
  
I wanna spread my wings  
But I just can't fly  
As a string of pearls  
The pretty girls go sailin' by  
  
Ocean deep  
I'm so afraid to show my feelings  
I have sailed a million ceilings  
Solitary room  
  
Ocean deep  
Will I ever find a lover  
Maybe she has found another  
And as I cry myself to sleep  
I know this love of mine I'll keep  
Ocean deep  
  
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely (Ocean deep)  
On my own in my room  
I'm so lonely  
(Ocean deep)  
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely  
This love of mine  
I'll be ocean deep  
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely  
In my room

Oh no, don't let go - everything is gonna be fine  
I just need some time  
Give me a little more time - so don't let go  
Oh well night after night I'm a little confused  
I can't seem to get it right still I might  
With a little assistance and a piece of your love  
Get closer to your heart  
Well at least it would be a start - so don't let go  
Oh no, don't let go - all I need is a little more time  
Oh no, don't let go - everything is gonna be fine  
I just need some time  
Give me a little more time - so don't let go  
Well I'll try - I mean I will attempt to negotiate  
This little incline -  
Whoops there's a hill and another spectacular chance  
For me to be -  
Once again with you and I know I'll make it through  
So don't let go  
Oh no, don't let go - all I need is a little more time  
Oh no, don't let go - everything is gonna be fine

Give me a little more time - so don't let go

How hard it is to get it alright

I see heart broken pieces everywhere  
Wouldn't you try wouldn't you know  
Try so hard still you let it all go  
Too much trouble too much pain  
I think I'm gonna have that luck again  
  
What'll I do if you walk away  
What'll I do if you walk away  
Well I haven't a chance  
No I haven't a chance  
  
Once in a while I get this feelin'  
Now and again I'm all in a daze  
Time after time I ask myself this  
Will you walk away?  
Once in a while I get this feelin'  
Seems all day and night time too  
I don't belong I'm just passin' through  
I guess you're right I think too much  
Still in all, I miss your touch  
A crazy notion a careless thought  
I start to worry and time gets short  
Well think of this my dear young one  
The time to act has just begun  
  
What'll I do if you walk away  
What'll I do if you walk away  
Well I haven't a chance  
No I haven't a chance

These are things that I don't understand  
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand  
  
I can't, and I can't decide  
Wrong, all my wrong from right  
Day, all my day for night  
Or dark, all my dark for light  
I live, but I love this life

And the saints go marching in  
  
And sing slow it down

My drunken as a Daniel in a lion's den  
And tonight I know it all has to begin again  
So whatever you do, don't let go  
  
And if we could float away  
Fly up to the surface and just start again  
And lift off before trouble  
Just erodes us in the rain  
  
Just erodes us in the rain  
Just erodes us and see roses  
In the rain

From the rooftops I remember  
There was snow  
White snow  
  
Clearly I remember  
From the windows they were watching  
While we froze down below  
  
When the future's architectured  
By a carnival of idiots on show  
You'd better lie low  
  
[Chorus]  
If you love me  
Won't you let me know?  
  
Was a long and dark December  
When the banks became cathedrals  
And the fox  
Became God  
  
Priests clutched onto bibles  
Hollowed out to fit their rifles  
And the cross was held aloft  
  
Bury me in armour  
When I'm dead and hit the ground  
My nerves are poles that unfold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to be a soldier  
With the captain of some sinking ship  
Would stow, far below  
  
So if you love me  
Why'd you let me go?  
  
I took my love down to violet hill  
There we sat in snow  
All the time she was silent and still

I used to roll the dice  
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes  
Listen as the crowd would sing  
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""  
  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
Once you go there was never, never an honest word  
That was when I ruled the world  
  
It was a wicked and wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I'd become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my head on a silver plate  
Just a puppet on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Calvary choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field

Never rule this world
