Whether you will's anybody's guess

But I'm just so tired of this loneliness  
  
So, up they picked me by the big toe  
I was held from the rooftop, then they let go  
There's only screaming  
Let the windows, down  
As I crawl to the ground  
  
If you'll only, if you'd only say yes

Cole Porter,Anything Goes,/c/cole+porter/anything+goes_20289240.html,"Times have changed  
And we've often rewound the clock  
Since the Puritans got a shock  
When they landed on Plymouth Rock.  
If today  
Any shock they should try to stem  
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,  
Plymouth Rock would land on them.  
  
In olden days, a glimpse of stocking  
Was looked on as something shocking.  
But now, God knows,  
Anything goes.  
Good authors too who once knew better words  
Now only use four-letter words  
Writing prose.  
Anything goes.  
If driving fast cars you like,  
If low bars you like,  
If old hymns you like,  
If bare limbs you like,  
If Mae West you like,  
Or me undressed you like,  
Why, nobody will oppose.  
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in-  
Truding in nudist parties in  
Studios.  
Anything goes.  
  
When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)  
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her,  
Then I suppose  
Anything goes.  
When Rockefeller still can hoard en-  
Ough money to let Max Gordon  
Produce his shows,  
Anything goes.  
The world has gone mad today  
And good's bad today,  
And black's white today,  
And day's night today,  
And that gent today  
You gave a cent today  
Once had several chateaux.  
When folks who still can ride in jitneys  
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys  
Lack baby clo'es,  
Anything goes.  
  
If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction  
Instruct Anna Sten in diction,  
Then Anna shows  
Anything goes.  
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up  
Now turns a handspring landing up-  
On her toes,  
Anything goes.  
Just think of those shocks you've got  
And those knocks you've got  
And those blues you've got  
From that news you've got  
And those pains you've got  
(If any brains you've got)  
From those little radios.  
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's,  
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons  
'Cause Franklin knows  
Anything goes.

by Cole Porter  
  
With a million neon rainbows burning below me,  
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar,  
Here I sit, above the town,  
In my pet-paillated gown,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor.  
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet,  
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more,  
I'm deserted and depressed  
In my regal-eagle nest,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor.  
When the only one you wanted wants another,  
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?  
Why, even the janitor's wife  
Has a perfectly good love life,  
And here I am, facing tomorrow,  
Alone in my sorrow,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor

Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,  
I concentrate on you.  
  
When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me  
And people declare ""You're through!"",  
Whenever the blues become my only song,  
I concentrate on you.  
  
On your smile so sweet, so tender,  
When at first your kiss I decline.  
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,  
And once again our arms intertwine  
  
And so, when wise men say to me  
That love's young dream never comes true,  
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,  
I concentrate on you.

Than ever marry one of them, I'd rest a maiden rather  
For husbands are a boring lot and only give you bother  
Of course, I'm awfully glad that mother deemed to marry father  
But I hate men  
  
Of all the types I've ever met within our democracy  
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy  
He may have hair upon his chest but, sister, so has Lassie  
Oh, I hate men  
  
I hate men  
They should be kept like piggies in a pen  
  
Don't wed a trav'ling salesman though a tempting Tom he may be  
For on your wedding night he may be off to far Araby  
While he's away in Mandalay it is thee who have the baby  
Oh, I hate men  
  
If thou shouldst wed a businessman, be wary, oh, be wary  
He'll tell you he's detained in town on business necessary  
His business is the business with his pretty secretary  
Oh, I hate men  
  
I hate men  
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen  
  
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism  
He'll always stay at home at night and make no criticism  
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism  
Oh, I hate men  
  
From all I've read alone in bed, from A to Z, about them  
Since love is blind, then from the mind, all womankind should rout them  
But, ladies, you must answer too, what would we do without them?  
Still, I hate men

When we started painting the town  
We'd have been aware that our love affair

Still selling those pictures of the scriptures in the duomo  
And Carolina, where are you, 'lina?

Not too far  
All fenced in like a movie stars  
We'll call him Ace  
Lying there by the fireplace  
A goldfish pond and a wishing well  
Everything is gonna turn out swell.

Upon that tree ""I'll Love You Till I Die"".

And wherever you go  
You'll always know ""I'll Love You Till I Die""...

Almost persuaded  
To put my conscience aside.  
  
Then we danced and she whispered I need you

Then I looked in her eyes and I saw it

Hey, it's good to be back home again  
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend  
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again  
  
Oh, the time that I can lay this tired old body down  
Feel your fingers feather soft upon me  
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way  
The happiness that livin' with you brings me  
  
It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you  
It's the little things that make a house a home  
Like a fire softly burnin' and supper on the stove  
The light in your eyes that makes me warm  
  
Hey, it's good to be back home again, you know it is  
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend  
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again  
I said hey, it's good to be back home again

Conway Twitty,Back Street Affair,/c/conway+twitty/back+street+affair_20512023.html,"You didn't know I wasn't free  
When you fell in love with me  
And with all your young heart, you learned to care  
It brought you shame and disgrace  
The world has tumbled in your face  
Because they call our love a back street affair.  
  
They say you wrecked my home  
I'm a husband that's gone wrong  
They don't know the sorrow that we've had to bear  
For the one that I'm tied to  
Was the first to be untrue  
And yet they call our love a back street affair.  
  
We have each other now  
That's all that matters anyhow  
For the judgement of gossip's never fair  
We'll just be brave and strong  
Then some day they'll see they're wrong  
So let 'em call our love a back street affair.  
  
We'll be free to love someday  
When all the talk has died away  
And the happiness we hoped for then we'll share  
I'll climb a mountain high  
And then the world can hear me cry  
That our love's not a back street affair...

Taking my clothes and my food and a trash can  
Sleeping in alleys at night, making love to a bottle of wine  
Cause you know life is to succeed  
But that was back when Judy loved me  
Somewhere in yesterday, seems a million miles away.  
  
Back in the days Judy used to beg me to take her away  
But I was too young and livin' was fun  
I didn't know how time would change me  
Life slid by me too fast, the fun didn't last  
It's too late to get back to the days when Judy loved me.  
  
Riding a freight train goin' nowhere  
Don't use mirrors anymore, they show my grey hair  
Giving my place in the welfare line  
Trading my soup for a bottle of wine  
Cause you know life is to succeed  
But that was back when Judy loved me.

Conway Twitty,Bad Boy,/c/conway+twitty/bad+boy_20455826.html,"Everyday your husband goes to work from nine to five  
Wakes up in the morning and puts on his coat and tie  
Sits down at the table with some coffee and the news  
""Two eggs over easy,"" girl, that's all he says to you  
The kids are all in school now and you sit home alone  
Spendin' all your time down it the basement a-washin' clothes  
Somehow this just ain't the way you dreamed love would be  
I can look into your eyes and tell just what you need.  
  
You need a bad boy  
To love you up and down  
A bad boy  
To take you on the town  
It's plain to see what you need's  
A little bit of mystery  
You need a bad boy  
A bad boy like me.  
  
Every night at six o'clock he walks on through the door  
Lays down on the couch and throws his shoes off on the floor  
Tonight was gonna be the night he took you to a show  
Now he's much too tired and he doesn't wanna go  
Once again you spend the night in front of the TV  
In bed you turn to touch him but he's already asleep.

Conway Twitty,Bad Man,/c/conway+twitty/bad+man_20512034.html,"I have the reputation that's known throughout the land  
They say I'm master on the draw of any livin' man  
They call me a bad man, they say I kill for fun  
They say the only thing I know is how to use a gun  
But they don't know the reason they branded me as bad  
It started many years ago when I was just a lad  
  
I rode into a cattle town, a boy of twenty-three  
So young and yet that very day I carved my destiny  
I walked into the town saloon that sad and faithful day  
Then I began to gamble to pass the time away  
I thought I played a hand or two then hit the thrill again  
But Lady Luck was with me and I began to win  
  
The dealer kept on dealin', the stakes were gettin' high  
And pretty soon there was no one left but an old cowboy and I  
The minutes seemed like hours, you couldn't hear a sound  
We've been in race until we'd lay all our money down  
The cowboy smiled and showed his hands, three aces he did hold  
But I laid down the royal flush and reached to claim my gold  
  
The cowboy stood and faced me, his hands hung on his hips  
A look of hate was in his eyes and the smile had left his lips  
He said, ""Young man, slap leather, I'm known for miles around  
To keep my reputation about I got to gun you down""  
White lightnin' speeded through that fire, one life will be the cost  
The cowboy crumbled to the floor, his reputation lost  
  
Now years have come and years have gone and many men have died  
He's tried his luck and hoped he'd be the fastest gun alive  
And in my many fights to live, I wondered if I'd won  
I'm known by all the bad men, they think I kill for fun  
Someday I'll meet the cowboy who's speed will meet the test  
And that will in the saga of the bad man of the west

Conway Twitty,Bad Seed My Daddy Sowed,/c/conway+twitty/bad+seed+my+daddy+sowed_20512035.html,"I was found in Wilson County just a mile outside of town  
On the doorsteps of two people who brought me up to where I am  
I was born to be a loser and my name nobody knows  
And as far as they concern I'm just a bad seed daddy sowed  
They brough me up to the age of ten before they let me know  
And since that day it seemed that life lost its magic glow  
But they raised me right and every night in prayer we bowed our heads  
And they asked the Lord to light my path and guide each step I made  
But the path you're walking on becomes a mighty rocky road  
When you know that all you'll ever be is a bad seed daddy sowed  
At thirty one my heart was won by a girl half my age  
And with love so strong I could see no wrong in decision that I made  
And you know I learned that there was truth in all I always been told  
Because you can't judge a book by its cover  
And everything that's shinin' sure isn't gold  
Yes I guess I'm guilty of dreaming an impossible dream  
Because the way the things turned out sure isn't way it seemed  
And so tonight I'm leavin' behind the only thing I ever had to call my own  
And I know as long as you live you're always be a reminder of all my wrongs  
But I hope that he'll forgive me when he's old enough to know  
That just like me he'll always be the bad seed his daddy sowed

He laid down to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes  
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs  
It took us seven hours and I guess we must have drunk a case of beer  
  
I guess I oughta go and watch 'em put him down but I don't own the suit  
And anyway when they start talkin' bout the fire and hell well I get spooked  
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass  
And anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass  
  
Well here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine  
Hm look at all that chrome I do believe that that's the sharpest thing I've
seen  
That must belong to his great uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm  
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm  
  
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that  
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black  
He's not even in the ground and they say his track is up for sale  
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil  
  
Now listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps  
I think that when you's in the war they always hired and played a song like
that  
Well here I am and there they go and I guess you'd call it my bad luck  
I hope he'll rest in peace but trouble is that fellow owed me forty bucks

It's hard to go on when I never win.  
  
My life, (my life) my destiny, (my destiny.)  
Is loneliness (loneliness) and misery. (misery.)  
My life, I didn't choose.

Conway Twitty,Bring It On Home To Your Woman,/c/conway+twitty/bring+it+on+home+to+your+woman_20512001.html,"Oh, I've got a few good words to lay on everybody  
It's about a man too blind to understand  
The way I've treated my woman was a doggone pity  
But we know there's a weakness in every man.  
  
Just like a fool I went and left my baby crying  
A different kind of lovin' I had on my mind  
But everybody that I met was either cheatin' or lying  
When I get a good thing at home all the time.  
  
It's a lonely old feeling when you go from town to town  
When you can't get the woman at home off your mind  
I'm so tired of livin' in this new world that I've found  
Lord I hope I didn't waste too much time.  
  
I gotta put my pride aside and call my baby  
Gotta do it now can't wait another day  
I dialed a number and then I heard the voice of my lady  
It blew my mind when I heard her say.  
  
And she said (bring it on home) to your woman  
I've got a lot of lovin' a waitin' I hope you ain't forgot  
And she said (bring it on home) to your woman  
And when you get there you better  
Give me all the love you've got.

Burn, Georgia burn  
There's a fire in your soul  
Am I to blame for the flame?  
That's out of control.  
  
Now twenty-five and the first time makes a woman kinda wild  
When wall flowers turn to roses, they take on a certain style  
Now I ain't sayin' she was wrong, as she took a wayward turn  
But I remember the fire I started, burn, Georgia burn.

For who I am has long been tied and tangled up in her.  
  
And it isn't luck or chance she can read me at a glance  
Not just because she's clever and she's smart  
No, it's just by now she knows my heart  
By heart.  
  
It seems like it's been centuries since she and I began  
And both of us took all our chances on a single hand  
Though we took it day to day it's gone from year to year  
And no one ever close to me was ever half as near.  
  
And it isn't any trick or because her mind is quick  
She reaches my conclusions as I start  
No, it's just by now she knows my heart  
By heart.  
  
And amazing as it seems she brings magic to my dreams  
Not just because she's mastered magic's art  
No, it's just by now she knows my heart  
By heart.  
  
She knows my heart...

A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights.  
  
Lights that say forget her name in a glass of sherry wine  
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine  
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright  
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights.  
  
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night  
But God who put the stars above I don't believe made those lights  
For it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right  
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights

In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler  
We were poor, but we had love  
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of  
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.  
  
My daddy worked all night in the Vanleer coal mine  
All day long in the field a-hoin' corn  
Mommie rocked the babies at night  
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light  
And ever'thing would start all over come break of morn'.  
  
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay  
Mommie scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day  
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed  
To complain there was no need  
She'd smile in Mommie's understanding way.  
  
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear  
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair  
From a mail order catalog  
Money made from sellin' a hog  
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.  
  
Yeah!, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter  
I remember well - the well where I drew water  
The work we done was hard  
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired  
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler.  
  
Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then  
And it's so good to be back home again  
Not much left but the floor  
Nothing lives here anymore  
Except the mem'ries of a coal miner's daughter.

That I'd have a desperado love for you  
  
I know that it breaks every law  
To feel the way I'm feelin'  
But I want your love so desperately  
I don't see the wrong in stealin'  
  
So hold on I'm gonna shoot for the heart  
Like desperadoes do  
I got a desperado love for you  
  
It's so wrong to take what isn't mine  
And head out for the border  
But I can't look at you and have  
Respect for law and order  
  
So hold on I'm gonna shoot for the heart  
Like desperadoes do  
I got a desperado love for you  
I got a desperado love for you

You'll forget me by and by  
You're just fifteen I'm twenty two

Got me a job and tried to settle down  
But her words kept haunting my memory

Jimmy please say you'll wait for me  
I'll grow up someday you'll see  
Savin' all my kisses just for you  
Signed with love forever true  
  
I packed my clothes and I caught a plane  
I had to see Joni, I had to explain  
How my heart was filled with her memory  
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me  
  
I ran all the way to the house next door  
But things weren't like they were before  
My teardrops fell like rain that day

It's been five years since you've been gone

And only been in love a night or two  
They see a beautiful woman in the shadows with a man  
And all they see is a weekend rendezvous  
Guess we look like cheaters  
Lovers lyin' low  
We must be deceivers  
'Cause baby they don't know  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Can't get over the feel of you  
Something in the way you make your moves  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Runnin' deep, runnin' strong  
It's been goin' on and on and on and on for years  
You make it easy to be a one woman man  
Just look at you sitting there  
Your eyes are talkin' in that soft and sexy way  
Sayin' let's slip away, slip away somewhere  
It don't take a rainy night  
Or music in the dark  
But baby when your body sends  
A message to my heart  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Can't get over the feel of you  
Something in the way you make your moves  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Runnin' deep, runnin' strong  
It's been goin' on and on and on and on  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Can't get over the feel of you  
Something in the way you make your moves

On a dusty old shoe box  
And opened a door to the past  
Now I'm sittin' here with my souvenirs  
And these faded old photographs.  
  
Fightin' back tears  
Lookin' back through the years  
And wonderin' why dreams fade so fast  
Now the young boy I see  
Don't look like the me  
Reflected in this old looking glass.  
  
The man in the mirror  
Sees things so much clearer  
Than the boy in the pictures  
With his eyes full of dreams  
Oh, the men that I've tried to be  
From fifteen to forty-three  
Never believed that they'd end up like me.  
  
There's that touchdown I caught  
Back when I thought  
I'd play for the cowboys someday  
There's you holding me in my faded fatigues  
Comin' home to the you. S. A.  
  
One after another  
All my sweet dreams and lovers  
Pass before my tear filled eyes  
Pictures of a fool  
Who was selfish and cruel  
Till the day he made you say goodbye.  
  
The man in the mirror  
Sees things so much clearer  
Than the boy in the pictures  
With his eyes full of dreams

Talkin' bout you and me and the games people play  
  
Oh we make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye  
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame  
But neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten  
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been and it's a dirty rotten shame

And they're tryin' to sock it to ya in the name of the Lord

And furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board

Where the rising cost of raising children  
Was not a factor and you can't believe the things it does to me  
I'm filled with the white noise  
Well I never did much of anything anyway  
Jump on a big train no where  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna buy me a good heart, and a conscience,  
And maybe raise some children  
I wanna get me a good wife,  
And a garden, garden, garden, garden.  
Wanna start me a new life with a six foot color television-  
Wanna start me a new life somewhere.  
I was born on a warm night  
On the right coast, of southeastern America.  
Dead on arrival, but you can't believe the things you hear today.  
I'll fly me a white plane over  
Water -over blue and green and land in the ocean somewhere.  
  
[Chorus:]

Counting Crows,4 White Stallions,/c/counting+crows/4+white+stallions_20815280.html,"She had four white stallions coming up around the bend  
Four strong angels at her command to send  
Four more seasons, for all that's broken to mend  
  
I got four good reasons why I cant go back there again  
  
She had skin like a statue, milky white and pure  
Carved by an artist who's hand is demure  
Got a mind like a saber  
Razor sharp and sure  
  
God how I hate myself for still wanting her  
  
Tell me it's nicer dreaming, visions soft and sure  
No way to find there's nothing left to me and her  
Nothing more but a heart still at war  
  
She had four white stallions coming up around the bend  
Four strong angels already sent  
Four more seasons for all that's broken to mend

Counting Crows,A Good Year For The Roses,/c/counting+crows/a+good+year+for+the+roses_20033527.html,"I can hardly stand the sight of lipstick  
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray.  
Lying cold the way you left them,  
But at least your lips caressed them  
While you packed.  
Or the lip print o a half-filled cup  
Of coffee that you poured  
And didn't drink.  
But at least you thought you wanted it  
Which is so much more than I can say for me.  
  
Refrain  
  
It's been a good year for the roses  
Many blooms still linger there.  
The lawn could stand another mowing  
It's funny, I don't even care  
But as you turned and walked away  
As the door behind you closes  
The only thing I thought to say  
Was what a good year for the roses  
  
After three, four years of marriage  
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed  
I guess the reason we're not talking,  
Is there's so little left to say that we haven't said  
While a million thoughts go racing through my mind  
I guess I haven't said a word  
From the bedroom, the familiar sound  
Of our one baby's crying goes unheard

Counting Crows,A Murder Of One,/c/counting+crows/a+murder+of+one_20033480.html,"Blue morning Blue morning  
Wrapped in strands of fist and bone  
Curiosity, Kitten, doesn't have to mean you're on your own  
Your can look outside your window  
He doesn't have to know  
We can talk awhile, baby  
We can take it nice and slow  
  
All your life is such a shame  
All your love is just a dream  
  
Are you happy where you're sleeping?  
Does he keep you safe and warm?  
Does he tell you when you're sorry?  
Does he tell you when you're wrong?  
I've been watching you for hours  
It's been years since we were born  
We were perfect when we started  
I've been wondering where we've gone  
  
All your life is such a shame  
All your love is just a dream  
  
I dreamt I saw you walking up a hillside in the snow  
Casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there counting crows  
One for sorrow  
Two for joy  
Three for girls and four for boys  
Five for silver  
Six for gold and  
Seven for a secret never to be told  
  
There's a bird that nests inside you  
Sleeping underneath your skin  
When you open up your wings to speak  
I wish you'd let me in  
  
All your life is such a shame  
All your love is just a dream  
Open up your eyes  
You can see the flames  
of your wasted life  
You should be ashamed  
  
You don't want to waste your life  
  
I walk along these hillsides in the summer 'neath the sunshine  
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me

Counting Crows,All My Love,/c/counting+crows/all+my+love_10071213.html,"Got a message in my head  
That the papers had all gone  
Richard Manuel is dead  
And the daylight's coming on  
I've been wandering through the dark  
Now I'm standing on the lawn  
  
If I could give all my love to you  
I could justify myself  
But I'm just not coming through  
You're a pill to ease the pain  
Of all the stupid things I do  
I'm an anchor on the line  
Of a clock that tells the time  
That is running out on you  
Well it was cold when I woke  
And the day was halfway done  
Nearly spring in San Francisco  
But I cannot feel the sun  
You were sleeping next to me  
But I knew that you'd be gone  
  
If I could give all my love to you  
I could justify myself  
But I'm just not coming through  
You're a pill to ease the pain  
Of all the stupid things I do  
I'm an anchor on the line  
Of a clock that tells the time  
That is running out on you  
Take some time before you go  
Think of monday's coming down  
And the people that you knew  
The ones that aren't around  
You've been fading day to day  
I've been moving town to town  
  
If I could give all my love to you  
I could justify myself  
But I'm just not coming through  
You're a pill to ease the pain  
Of all the stupid things I do  
I'm an anchor on the line  
Of a clock that tells the time  
That is running out on you

Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly  
Last night now they blew up his house too  
Down on the boardwalk  
They're gettin' ready for a fight  
Gonna see what them racket boys can do  
Now there's trouble busin'  
In from outta state and the D. A.  
Can't get no relief  
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade  
And the gamblin' commission's hangin' on by  
The skin of it's teeth  
[Chorus:]  
Well now everything dies baby that's a fact  
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back  
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty  
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City  
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away  
But I got debts that no honest man can pay  
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust  
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus  
[Chorus:]  
Now our luck may have died  
And our love may be cold  
But with you forever I'll stay  
We're goin' out  
Where the sand's turnin' to gold  
So put on your stockin's baby 'cause  
The night's getting cold  
And everything dies baby that's a fact  
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back  
Now I been lookin' for a job  
But it's hard to find  
Down here it's just winners and losers  
And don't get caught on the wrong side of that  
Line  
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end  
So honey last night I met this guy and  
I'm gonna do a little favor for him  
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact  
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back  
Put your hair up nice and set up pretty  
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City  
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City  
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City

With nothing beside you  
But webbing and curfews and rain?  
And everything that hurts you

Like butterflies with wings  
And other perfect things

Dangling from clotheslines

But did you ever see me?  
Me, absolutely?  
Me, but all you, but still me?
