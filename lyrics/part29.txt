With my pearl handled deck  
The county won't give me no more methadone  
And they cut off your welfare check

And I went to meet my man  
He hangs out down on Alvarado Street  
At the Pioneer Chicken stand

Counting Crows,Carriage,/c/counting+crows/carriage_20033535.html,"If anything it should have been a better thing,  
From underneath you  
Staring at the ceiling  
It's another world of chocolate bars  
And baseball cards and it hides  
Inside of all this tension that I'm feeling  
But it's all inside of you  
And it's all inside of you  
  
Surprise, Surprise  
I miss your hair, you miss my eyes  
And this solitude is my confidence eroding  
So We slide inside of someone's mouth  
And someone's eyes until  
There's a sound of something intimate exploding.  
But it's all inside of you  
It's all inside of you.  
  
I wish that I'd had anesthetized and sterilized and then  
I wouldn't have this evidence congealing  
Surprise, surprise  
Another pair of lips and eyes  
And that's the consequence from actually feeling.  
But it's all inside of you  
It's all inside of you

They have landed in L.A.  
Little pieces slowly settling on the waves

We'll still come around We will come around

I have started loving sorrow along the way  
I am calling from some city  
And I won't be there too long  
I could wait and I could waste away  
But what comes back is I hear you say we're gone  
  
For all of the times that I go spinning up and down  
When all of the things have died between us  
Well, we'll still come around We will come around  
  
After I've been missing for a while  
And you hear that summer's song  
Haven't all the fading lines lingered on?  
  
What I know is: she's going  
When you know it, it's alright  
So you put yourself between you and your pride  
If you wait for what's coming  
And you listen to her lies,  
Then she'll say the things you need to hear  
And the only one who'll disappear is you  
  
And one of the million lies she said  
Is ""All of the things you love are dead.""  
But I've seen what she thinks is love  
And it leaves me laughing so we'll still come around

A yellow rose so everyone could see

She's as pretty as could be  
She always wears a yellow rose so everyone can see

Suddenly we found we couldn't live just on our love  
Just two kids alone with thought of Kansas in our mind  
Thinking of the families loving arms we left behind  
Of each new day I found that we grew more and more apart  
Though she tried to cling to me with love still in her heart  
Then one day I hurt her like a fool I made her cry

Felt the wind's direction bringing change  
Clouds so softly it will rain  
And summer fell and the winter spring  
And now it's all a feeling I can't get back again  
  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Plotting thoughts against the clear blue sky  
And the feeling came I felt like getting high  
No sense to try to find my piece of mind  
Cause maybe baby I was born to win dissatisfied  
And you know your caring never dies so  
  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
Ah no ah no ah no  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Come on yeah  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
Come on come on and try  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
Not gonna have a rise  
Throw your arms around my neck  
Hold me hold me hold me  
I won't be soon to forget  
Gotta get out of my life  
Throw your arms around my neck  
Come on come on now shine  
I won't be soon to forget

Brush your hair back from your eyes.  
Take you down let the river flow.  
Sometimes I go and walk the street  
Behind the green sheet of glass.  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles, a million miles  
CHORUS:  
I'll be with you girl  
Like being low  
Hey hey hey like being stoned.  
I'll be with you girl  
Like being low  
Hey hey hey like being stoned.  
A million poppies gonna make me sleep.  
Just one rose and knows your name  
The fruit is rusting on the vine  
The fruit is calling from the trees  
Hey don't you wanna go down  
Like some junkie cosmonaut  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles a million miles

Blue blue is the sun.  
Brown brown is the sky.  
Green green of her eyes.

A million miles a million miles

And they take a little every day  
She is a victim of her own responses  
Shackled to a heart that wants to settle  
And then runs away  
It's a sin to be fading endlessly  
Yeah, but she's alright with me  
  
She is leaving on a walkaway  
She is leaving me in disarray  
In the absence of a place to be  
She stands there looking back at me  
Hesitates, and then turns away  
She'll change so suddenly  
She's just like mercury  
Yeah, but she's alright with me  
  
Keep some sorrow in your hearts and minds  
For the things that die before their time  
For the restlessly abandoned homes  
The tired and weary rambler's bones  
And stay beside me where I lie  
She's entwined in me  
Crazy as can be  
Yeah, but she's alright with me

Counting Crows,Palisades Park,/c/counting+crows/palisades+park_21085682.html,"Somebody screaming on Jim Jeffries' dreams  
Explode into a black fist and fall to the floor  
He stares up at the sky and he may wish he knew why  
But you can't go back there no more  
The future sounds so crazy, we all heard that song before  
Tomorrow's a name that changed from yesterday to blame  
When a train just don't stop here anymore  
  
I got starry eyed on a coaster ride  
Andy said, ""Man, I need a break from the world outside""  
And these days my life just careens through a pinball machine  
I could do so much better but I can't get off the tilt  
There's a photograph on a tv, black and white  
Andy says something to you  
Jack Johnson straddling Reno, Nevada like  
She says I forget myself sometimes, too  
  
But out past the doorways where we are sleeping  
Well, the white queen's creeping, the time cat's beeping  
  
Now I'm not breaking, the train's just shaking  
I never made it here before  
And there's a wide mouth spinning the girls around  
Till they can't take it any more  
I used to dream in the dark, in Palisades Park  
Up over the cliffs and down among the spark  
It's a long life full of long nights  
  
But it's not what I was waiting for  
Everybody's seen the horses driving down the shore  
It's a miracle they don't make them anymore  
  
So make up ladies, oh wake up baby  
You walked into the bar like some Saturday star  
Studs straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves  
And you're a downtown pride, fully amplified Clyde  
Gin-tied and Asian, but well preserved  
Remember Annie outside your bedroom window  
Saying, ""Come on, let's drive across to the Palisades""  
Keep going till we hit Reno, Nevada  
I don't see it all that much these days  
  
Still there are pages in back of the action stacks  
Where the white queen's creeping, the time cat's beeping  
  
The train's not breaking, the track's just shaking  
I never made it here before  
And there's a sky rocket turning the world around  
But still I can't take it any more  
And you carry that spark from Palisades Park  
Down over the cliffs and out into the dark  
It's a long life full of long nights  
  
But it's not what I was looking for  
Everyone dreams of horses flying round the shore  
It's a bad dream we're not having anymore  
  
Man, have you seen Andy?  
Hey man, hey man, have you seen him around?  
Hey man, have you seen my my my my my Andy?  
Hey man, have you seen him, have you seen him  
Have you seen him, have you seen him?  
Hey, have you seen Andy around?  
  
Dressed up in a pirate vest, all leathers and feathers and pearls  
Andy said, ""Look at me, man, I'm cooking  
These hands are gonna figure out this whole world""  
He said, ""Come outside, climb out your bedroom window  
Shimmy down the fire escape and say goodbye  
Come outside, "" Andy says, ""I'm dressed up just like Edie  
Changing all the time, my leopard spots to polka dots, just say goodbye  
Come outside, where maybe we can move to California  
Just meet me at the subway and say goodbye  
Come outside, the cops all think we're crazy  
If you steal, you'll just get married  
To a girl who'll never know you and then say goodbye""  
  
Hey man, have you seen Andy?  
I lost her in the cirque  
I was high as a kite on a lovely and white  
Man, you can lose anyone  
Hey, hey man, have you seen Andy?  
I don't know where she's gone  
Real love outlives teenage lust  
Oh, we could get wet and it keeps us warm  
Love is like angel dust  
Lovely sometimes changes us  
  
Sometimes we're not  
Have you been aching with trust or just  
Have you been waking yourself with lust?  
Have you been making us up or just taking us home?  
  
It's a long wait and a long life  
Cars frozen in flight  
All the traffic stops to stare  
At a crosswalk in Reno, Nevada  
Where nothing but air and a pair of gray paper wings  
Andy thinks, ""Man, I have got nothing to wear""  
We got nothing to wear  
We got nothing to wear  
We got nothing to wear  
We got nothing to wear

But you want me to say ""Hey, it's okay...""  
But I'm so dizzy baby, just get the hell away from me...  
How can you breathe?  
How can you see?  
I can't even sleep when you're with me...  
I'm sick of summertime  
I know, all of the best things in life are unkind  
To be everything I could be, anything  
But all the time I'm thinking, ""If I only had a pair of wings...""  
But you want touch me  
Just get your hands off me  
Don't touch me  
And baby, I can't see that you see  
How can you see?  
How can you breathe?  
I can't feel a thing when you're with me...  
I can't take it this way, I hope you understand,  
Don't you fucking touch me  
I can hardly stand to look at you  
How can you breathe?  
How can you see?  
How can you breathe?  
How can you see?  
I can't even sleep when you're with me

Counting Crows,The Ballad Of El Goodo,/c/counting+crows/the+ballad+of+el+goodo_20155962.html,"Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh  
And I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds  
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on  
But guns they wait to be stuck by, at my side is God  
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
  
There's people around who tell you that they know  
And places where they send you, and it's easy to go  
They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row  
But you know you don't have to, you can just say no  
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
  
I've been built up and trusted, broke down and busted  
But they'll get theirs and we will get ours if we can  
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on  
  
Years ago my heart was set to live, oh  
And I've been trying hard against strong odds  
It gets so hard at times like now to hold on  
But I'll fall if I don't fight, and at my side is God  
  
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on

I see God upon the ceiling  
I see angels overhead  
And he seems so close  
As he reaches out his hand  
We are never quite as close  
As we are led to understand

And I know, cause there she goes walking walking walking

With words half spoken

Believe it if you need it

But you never looked inside  
You would have seen us there  
You could've seen far  
You should've seen the magic  
In my hat full of stars  
  
I'm trying to live in the present  
But I keep tripping on the past  
Finding out reality, well clarity  
Comes in dribs and drabs  
No we never had the time  
For everything we had  
So it felt like we had nothing  
That's what makes this hat so sad  
It was a long, long time ago  
  
When all we had  
Was a hat full of stars...  
You would have seen us there  
You could've seen far  
You should've seen the magic  
In my hat full of stars  
  
Now whenever I'm alone  
And I think I might forget  
I wear my lucky hat  
Just like a crown up on my head  
'Cause all I have  
Is a hat full of stars...  
If you could see me now  
You would've seen far  
You should've seen the magic  
In my hat full of stars...

Bullforg doing it again,  
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles,  
What makes you think you're something special when you smile ?  
  
Childlike no one understands,  
Jackknife in your sweaty hands,  
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years,  
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears.  
  
Big man walking in the park,  
Wigwam frightened of the dark,  
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you,

You can talk to me, you can talk to me.  
You can talk to me if you're lonely you can talk to me.

One Christmas eve long ago  
When I asked ""What you doing this evening ?""

She'd be wearing a bright red bow

What they're up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
""Don't take it so hard we're headed for the North Pole""  
  
Now Minnie could not be persuaded  
That Santa just did not exist  
She swore if she put up some mistletoe  
Santa did come give her a kiss  
And there where she'd hung up her stockings  
All in their silky, soft, sheen  
She'd be laying in wait on a bear skin rug  
Where the cookies and milk could be seen

Was a real epiphany

Oh...without you  
  
Will I be able to sleep  
Will I lie in my bed and weep  
What if I forget  
And reach for you  
Will I dream about you  
My first night...my first night  
  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
And I wonder what I'll do, oh...  
  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
And I wonder how I'll get through  
Oh...without you

Like someone in mid dance  
Like a little old man  
When you first held me in your tiny grip  
You seemdd just like popeye  
With your cap and your souint  
  
Chorus:  
shall we sail away with bluebirds and clear skies  
no frowns today just smiles that will brighten our way  
and i'll take this old man by the hand  
to begin again... To begin again...  
  
When I first looked into eyes like mine  
I wondered what I learn  
To see through them in time  
When you first smiled with your toothless grin  
You broke my heart break open  
All the flood gates rushed in  
  
Chorus:  
shall we sail away with bluebirds and clear skies  
no frowns today just smiles that will brighten our way  
and i'll take this old man by the hand  
to begin again... To begin again...

The sound of a cricket crying in your ear

This old earth needs some loving now, so

Put on your green shoes  
Mother nature, she's calling to you  
To put on your green shoes  
Put on your green shoes and walk with me  
We'll go around back and plant a tree  
Help it grow and you will see  
The way the world was meant to be

Wonder how the world would be  
Without the shade of a redwood tree  
Without all the fish, the birds and the bees  
Springtime would be lonely, so

Cyndi Lauper,Rather Be With You,/c/cyndi+lauper/rather+be+with+you_10074724.html,"Sometimes I look at you  
Feel like I make you blue  
Wish I could make us all brand new  
Wish I had some mystery left  
To my personality  
Then I could wink at you  
And you'd laugh like you used to  
  
You know I think we'll make it through  
'Cause if it's all the same  
I'd rather be with you  
We could move on if you wanted to  
'Cause if it's all the same  
I'd rather be with you  
  
I know it's hard not to  
Continue what we do  
And remove a pattern  
Like an old tattoo  
I go with you  
You go with me  
But if we had some clarity  
Well maybe we could stop ourselves  
Before we both get silly  
  
You know I think we'll make it through  
'Cause if it's all the same  
I'd rather be with you  
We could move on if you wanted to  
'Cause if it's all the same  
I'd rather be with you  
  
Always felt strong  
We belong  
From the first time you stood next to me  
Am I still your girl?  
'Cause in a crowded world  
You are still the only man I see  
  
Maybe we'd stop ourselves  
Before we both get silly  
  
You know I think we'll make it through  
'Cause if it's all the same  
I'd rather be with you  
We could move on if you wanted to  
'Cause if it's all the same  
I'd rather be with you  
  
You know I think we'll make it through

I'd rather be with you  
We could move on if you wanted to

The only doll I've ever owned

But only now my love has grown  
And it gets stronger in every way  
And it gets deeper let me say  
And it gets higher day by day  
  
Do I love you my oh my  
River deep, mountain high  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
When you were a young boy did you have a puppy  
That always followed you around  
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy  
No I'll never let you down  
Cause it goes on and on like a river flows  
And it gets bigger baby and heaven knows  
And it gets sweeter baby as it grows  
  
Do I love you my oh my  
River deep, mountain high  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

And I love you baby like a robin loves to sing  
And I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his bag  
And I love you baby river deep mountain high

I will always be your friend  
  
Set your heart free

Said you can't say much about today  
Just that dark cloud coming back your way  
And that your dreams are all worn thin  
Well, you better stop with all that talk  
Before it all starts happening  
  
Set your heart free  
Listen to your heart  
  
When your heart is beating black and blue  
And the old world's knocking down on you  
And you're starting to become unglued  
Don't go there, come on, you know i love you  
  
Set your heart free [Repeats]

Cyndi Lauper,The Tide Is Turning,/c/cyndi+lauper/the+tide+is+turning_20035253.html,"I used to think the world was flat  
Rarely threw my hat into the crowd  
I felt I had used up my quota of yearning  
Used to look in on the children at night  
In the glow of their donald duck light  
And I frighten myself with the thought of my little ones burning  
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Satellites buzzing through the endless night  
Exclusive to moonshots and world title fights  
Jesus christ, imagine what it must be earning  
Who is the strongest  
Who is the best  
Who holds the aces  
The east  
Or the west  
This is the crap our children are learning  
And oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning  
  
Now the satellite's confused  
'cos on saturday night  
The airwaves were full of compassion and light  
And his silicon heart warmed  
To the sight of a billion candles burning  
But, I'm not saying that the battle is won  
But on saturday night all those kids in the sun  
Wrested technology's sword from the hand of the war lords  
Oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, the tide is turning

Cyndi Lauper,What A Thrill,/c/cyndi+lauper/what+a+thrill_20035257.html,"I dreamt last night that he held me tight  
In a bar we knew way back when -  
Drinkin' sloe gin  
Oh, what a thrill  
Oh, what a sin  
  
Oh then the band played ""Goodnight, Sweetheart""  
One more dance and we were ready to go.  
From the spark heel boppin'  
To the light of a steamed window.  
  
Oh, what a thrill  
Oh, what a sin.  
For a heart throb,  
Too long gone to cry again  
  
With them smoke-filled runaway kisses  
Some so young  
Chances are a million to one  
You got me startin' to believe  
That the thrill ain't never gone.  
  
Then I woke up in the dark to a different sound  
That was coming from my radio  
They were playin' somethin' else  
'sides ""Go, Johnny, Go Go Go""  
  
So I turned to my sweetie, said ""Roll over, Honey  
'Cause your mama's gonna show you some fun.""  
I said ""Roll over, Honey, cause  
The thrill ain't never gone.""  
  
Oh, what a thrill  
Oh, what a sin.  
For a heart throb,  
Too long gone to cry again  
  
Those smoke-filled runaway kisses  
Some so young  
Chances are a million to one  
You got me startin' to believe  
That the thrill is never gone.

Little liza was caressed  
By the music of the angels  
Playing underneath her dress  
She saw the great caruso  
And that's when she fell in love  
She'd think of him as elvis  
If she knew who elvis was  
  
Spinning round and round  
You can hear her moan  
She's all by herself  
But she's not alone  
  
Wonderful things happen to me  
Whenever I sing that white man's melody  
Wonderful wave - wash over me  
Whenever I sing that white man's melody  
  
By the shores of the gitchee goomee  
She was floating on her bed  
She was deaming of al jolson  
And what she thought he said  
  
He was looking in the mirror  
He was putting on the paint  
Said the hardest thing about this job  
Is being what you ain't  
  
Just an old white man  
In a strange new world  
Can you come out tonight  
Little buffalo girl  
  
Wonderful things happen to me  
Whenever I sing that white man's melody  
Wonderful wave - wash over me  
Whenever I sing that white man's melody  
  
From the loins of the liberace  
Sprang a million little tunes  
And they whirled around eliza  
Like so many little moons  
Every jewel held a secret  
Every flourish held a clue  
As he held her in a rapture  
Singing I'll be seeing you  
  
Wonderful things happen to me  
Whenever I sing that white man's melody  
Wonderful wave - wash over me  
Whenever I sing that white man's melody

He sings a love song  
As we sing along  
Walking in a winter wonderland

He'll say: Are you married?  
We'll say: No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
We'll face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
Until the alligators knock him down  
  
When it snows, ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play
