The flowers stood and paid their due.  
And all the folk, they sang of a good rhyme  
While drinking all they wanted to.  
A bitter sweet, this final evening,  
Before he must leave her side...  
  
They danced around the glass filled tables  
While fiddlers played so sweet and low.  
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other,  
However would she let him go?  
And when the time it came upon them,  
She said in case we forget...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
The letters came and every single Sunday  
We all would wait to hear the news.  
She knew her love would be home someday,  
The only thing she held on to.  
We sang a song just like we used to  
And she said before we could leave...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.

With words that only she could know.  
They held each other till the morning  
And when it was his time to go.

There's got be an easy way out.  
I've got to be the one to say I'm sorry for pretending.  
It's all gone wrong, will you wait?

Heaven and earth, you and I  
A world we will always be  
Here in the silence we lie  
Shadows we cast, you and I  
Speak for eternity

Pressed between pages  
Flowers will die  
Stories may end as time passes by  
You and I will always be  
  
With every word that I hear  
Whenever whispers are near  
I can believe in fate  
Promises made, only one  
  
Yesterday fades from the sun  
And falls to a new embrace  
Years overflow  
As rivers run dry  
  
Here in a moment of time passing by  
You and I will always be, will always be

Air Supply,American Hearts,/a/air+supply/american+hearts_20004807.html,"They were married in September back in 1969  
They travelled, these two Indians,  
To find some peace of mind  
They stood for love and freedom  
They were children of their time oh oh  
  
They lived in a world that was cold and uncaring  
They swore they would change it  
with loving and shareing  
They'll never live like their parents have done  
Their innocence shone like the sun  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
Now they've got a family and a cottage in the hills  
He's always working late to pay the mortgage and the bills  
And she has trouble sleeping  
So the doctor gives her pills oh oh  
  
Who are these strangers who used to be lovers  
Now they've got nothing to say to each other  
Too far apart to discuss their mistakes  
They filed for divorce and it breaks their  
  
American hearts, so fiIled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
Ah - American hearts  
Ah - American hearts, American hearts  
  
Now that it's over they'll each go on living  
Never forgetting but somehow forgiving  
They'll care for their children protect them with pride  
And that's how their dream will survive in

Whose gates at dawn we all must pass

Whose music shall be day and night

You see the world start to sing, and the fire inside you begins.

And don't count the cost because, there is no other way.  
These times will change, and people must grow but  
Until you do, you live the only life that you know  
And the wild fire lets you go.

Leaving you, with a feeling you never knew  
At first it lasts, and then it's past, it's crazy love.

We play so small a part  
But we started from somewhere  
  
All the friends that I can think of  
Know what's going to happen to them  
If they don't think on today and plan ahead for their tomorrow  
Here we are just lucky children breaking out of the shell  
I'll take your hand today and love you till we reach

Came the holy power,  
When the gods were one  
Searching for a new home,  
Searching for this land

The pillars of the temple,  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find

The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again, will fear it again  
And it's here in the heart of the rose  
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you,  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken, none can stand before  
This is the hour, now is the time  
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine  
All that we must be, is everything we see

And it's our love that will go on forever

Before it's time

It is the rivers that run  
And through us this secret flows  
And now our destiny calls,

And all of the answers were clear  
Remember the times when our souls would ignite

And being with you now is the only  
Thought that's strong,  
It's a lonely night, and I'm trying  
To hold on...

Winding down the window clever again

So on finding out the name of the game

Who wants to go thru' the gears anyway  
The same color the same design  
The same car with a different mind

I bring a smile, and, saying I'm losing my mind  
I realize that you've been wasting my time  
  
You know you must believe me, it's so good to see you here  
I really tried to get away, it seems like it's been years  
I wish you could've warned me, you act like it's the end  
Oooohhhhh, I'm late again....Yeah....  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
No one home, yes I'm late again.....  
Our love, guess I'll wait again.....

As long as I live all that I receive is what I want to give to you  
I know that if I can stay for a while you will soon love me too  
Let's take a chance at least we'll learn a lesson  
It beats hanging round waiting for moments that wait into days  
I don't want to love you in two different ways  
  
Do you want to give, do you want to give me you whole day and more  
Do you want to give, do you want always the key to the door  
It's easy for you talking your way out of all situations  
When you can't see thru' and leave it up to me  
And that's what I do  
And that's what I do  
  
  
Love comes to me and leaves me with you  
Love runs thru' me in all that you do  
Don't walk away, don't leave me standing here  
That's not the way, don't lead me anywhere  
I need you now, I need you now  
Don't leave me standing here  
Oh, I don't know, I just don't know  
It's much too fast for me can't we go slow  
Oh, I don't know, I just don't know  
What do you want me to do

Love is where we all begin  
And when we knock on heaven's door  
Only love will let us in  
  
And as we gather to ourselves  
A part of everything we see  
We realize that what we own  
Isn't what we really need  
  
Innocence take my hand  
And speak through the one thought in your mind

Or I can make it disappear by the dawn  
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made  
And I can make all your demons be gone

I like to touch your perfect skin

To show you more than I have ever shown before  
If you could read what's on my mind  
Give me yours and I'll give you mine

More than we know  
We should be, we should see

Something we need to see  
Is it love, yes its love  
Only love that is growing inside me  
If it's love, yes it's love  
Only love, is the pillar of plenty  
  
You, you make me feel, this is all I need  
And it's all so real  
You help me understand, where I want to be  
When I touch your hand  
  
I can see to the shadow of the sun  
We can be in the shadow of the sun  
  
Untie the sails, the shore will melt away  
Without a trace, I hear the raven say  
When it's love, this is love, when it's love  
That we must know we must enter  
This is love, this is love, only love  
When the dove is descended  
  
You are the winding stream going to somewhere  
That we' ve never seen  
You, are the dare to dream and the silent scream  
And the final prayer  
  
I can see to the shadow of the sun  
We can be in the shadow of the sun  
Reach out for the shadow of the sun  
Cry out for the shadow of the sun  
You are the colors of the wind  
Singing hopes, eternal spring  
In a symphony for every lonely year  
You are the keeper of the key  
And the one that longs to be  
The light for each and every frozen tear

Sometimes we're just lonely hearts  
That ride upon a floating card  
Prepared to live those sleepless nights  
For precious time in paradise  
And now I find the future's gone  
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone  
I tried for it all  
She never heard me call at all  
There's no regrets, we made the choice  
We listened to that silent voice  
That haunts you 'til you just give in  
And makes you like a child again  
We drifted close then said goodbyes  
Just reading well each other's eyes  
The world had turned while we stood still  
And held on to each other  
And in between the right and wrong  
Is somewhere that sometimes you can belong  
I tried for it all  
She never heard me call  
And now I find the future's gone  
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone  
I cried for it all

Little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit restless and I dream of something wild  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and cry  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right  
Cause we'll never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now I'm only falling apart  
There's nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart

In the lane, snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song, as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is parson brown  
He'll say are you married, we'll say no man  
But you can do the job when you're in town  
  
Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mr. snowman  
Until the other kids knock him down  
  
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'  
Though your nose gets chillin'  
We'll frolic and play the eskimo way  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland

To the one you do belong  
So glad we met and you stayed  
Though it wasn't very long  
Was it only just a dream  
It's over now it seems  
If there were no goodbyes  
Would you stay that you still care  
I won't believe my eyes  
When I see you won't be there  
'Cause this love so hard to find  
Now you're leavin' me behind  
Oh please  
  
CHORUS:  
Show me and tell me  
How do you put this love aside  
(And) Put it away for another time  
With no guarantee that you'll be mine  
A fool I am it seems  
'Cause I'll been lovin' you in my dreams  
Until I wake up and I find out  
That time ain't our friend  
I'll just stay a fool till the end  
  
(Till the end, I'll be a fool)  
(Till I find it's me and you)  
If it only was game  
Why'd you have to fool my heart  
Oh girl ain't it a shame  
That we promised from the start  
That our love was here to stay  
For each and everyday  
If I had only known  
And if I didn't have to care  
Then being all alone  
It wouln't be so hard to bear  
This love so hard to find  
That we're leavin' here behind  
Oh please  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I maybe over acting  
I know I must stay strong  
But you pulled the string too hard  
And now we're going on our own  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Till the end  
You know I just stay a fool

There's no one home but you  
You're all that's left me too  
  
And when my love  
For life is running dry  
You'll come and pour yourself on me

At one time I'd be with you  
Tomorrow and today  
Beside you all the way  
  
If the world should start revolving  
Spinning slowly down to die  
I'd spend the end with you  
And when the world was through  
  
Then one by one  
The stars would all go out  
Then you and I would simply fly away

You've givin' me signs of affection

The future's not yours to give  
Just stand there a little longer  
And let me watch you while you leave

I turn to him and he kisses me  
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves  
Softly he breathes and I close my eyes  
Sharing our love under stormy skies
