And it echoes off of nothing as the trees come down  
It's the sound of a sparrow hittin' the ground  
It's the sound of one eternity bound  
It's the sound of one eternity bound  
There's a cry in the oceans, it's plaintive and blue  
And it rises from the depths, breaks my heart in two  
It's the dreams of the great whales running aground  
For they know that they're eternity bound  
For they know that they're eternity bound  
Whoa eternity bound  
Once they've passed into the timeless, they can never more be found  
Is there anybody listening, tell me can you hear the sound  
Of the gentle ones eternity bound  
Of the gentle ones eternity bound  
There's a cry in the heart of every woman and man  
We've been crying in the darkness since the world began  
Will we ever seek forgiveness, will we ever earn the crown  
Or are we in turn eternity bound  
Or are we in turn eternity bound  
Whoa eternity bound  
Once we've past into the timeless, we can never more be found  
Is there anybody listening, tell me can you hear the sound  
Of the lonely ones eternity bound  
Of the lonely ones eternity bound

The land of midnight sun  
And crossed the North Atlantic  
When this century was young  
They'd heard that in America  
Every man was free  
To live the way he chose to live  
And be who he could be  
  
Some of them were farmers there  
And tilled the frozen soil  
But all they got was poverty  
For all their earnest toil  
They say one was a sailor  
Who sailed the wide world round  
Made home port--got drunk one night  
Walked off the pier and drowned  
  
My mother was of Scottish blood  
It's there that she was born  
They brought her to America in 1924  
They left behind the highlands  
And the heather covered hills  
And came to find America  
With broad, expectant dreams  
And iron wills  
  
My grandad worked the steel mills  
Of central Illinois  
His daughter was his jewel  
His son was just his boy  
For thirty years he worked the mills  
And stoked the coke-fed fires  
And looked toward the day  
When he'd at last turn 65  
And could retire  
  
And the sons become the fathers  
And the daughters will be wives  
As the torch is passed from hand to hand  
And we struggle through our lives  
Though the generations wander  
The lineage survives  
And all of us  
From dust to dust  
We all become forefathers  
By and by  
  
The woman and the man were wed  
Just after the war  
And they settled in this river town  
And three fine sons she bore  
One became a lawyer  
And one fine pictures drew  
And one became this lonely soul  
Who sits here now  
And sings this song to you  
  
And the sons become the fathers  
And the daughters will be wives  
As the torch is passed from hand to hand  
And we struggle through our lives  
Though the generations wander  
The lineage survives  
And all of us

Like the phases of the moon.  
There ain't no easy answers  
You know there's only shades of grey  
But when it's love or it's survival  
I guess you gotta get away.

I watched her lovely light go out  
The light went out  
And floating in the black of space  
I was looking into god's own face  
And in his hand he held this tiny earth  
He said well ain't it a shame what they've done to her  
After I'd shown them to the holy road, the holy road  
After I'd shown them to the holy road, the holy road  
Well, I laid a bounty in their hands  
And only gave them ten commands  
But they never learned their lessons very well  
And they drove my garden straight to hell  
That's when they fell off of the holy road, the holy road  
That's when they fell off of the holy road, the holy road  
Let me tell you  
Well the popes were frauds and the kings were fools  
And your presidents only dupes and tools  
And the money makers and the chiefs of staff  
Who worshipped of that golden calf  
They turned their backs upon the holy road, the holy road  
They turned their backs upon the holy road, the holy road  
And then I told him  
Well you made the sun and you made the sky  
The things that crawl and the things that fly  
And then you made the human race  
And he said well everybody makes mistakes  
I thought they'd want to walk the holy road, the holy road  
I thought they'd want to walk the holy road, the holy road  
And even though it was just a dream  
It seemed as real as it could seem  
And often dreams the truth forebodes

Get back children on the holy road  
Get back children on the holy road

Holy road, the holy road  
Gotta get back on the holy road, the holy road

Wearisome vigil

I remember you said  
That you don't want to forget me

Which of our fantasies fled.  
  
Every tomorrow  
Looking to borrow  
A piece of today  
Run a bit faster  
Here comes the catcher  
Making his play  
You had better not stay  
You will soon be surrounded

Which of our fantasies stay.  
  
Lonely and winsome  
Calling for someone  
Living right now

Ugly and hollow  
Doesn't even allow you  
To want to know how  
You might  
  
Live for the living  
Give for the giving  
Moment by moment  
One day at a time

His hands were meant for different work

He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait  
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand  
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul  
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel

She knows when I am tired and she knows just what to do

The warm and rocky weather  
Take the roads that I have walked  
Looking for tomorrow's time  
Peace of mind --  
As your life spills into mine  
Changing with the seasons  
Filling up the world with time  
Change time to reasons  
I can show you all the songs  
That I never sang to someone before.  
We have seen a million stars  
Lying by the water  
You have climbed the hills with me  
To the mountain shelter  
Taking off the days  
One by one  
Setting them to breath  
In the sun.  
Take the lilies and the lace  
From the days of childhood  
All the willow winding paths  
Leading up and outward  
This is what I give  
This is what I ask you for  
Nothing more.

Dan Fogelberg,Song For A Carpenter,/d/dan+fogelberg/song+for+a+carpenter_20823146.html,"Oh, he makes his life as a carpenter  
He works his hands in wood  
And he lives the way his granddad  
Might have liked and understood  
  
He goes to work each morning  
And he comes home every night  
And the time that passes in between  
He knows has been spent right  
  
A child in South Ohio  
A man in Northern Maine  
He took his dream to the end of the world  
And he brought it back again  
  
Here he met his sweet Rebekah  
Here he came to make his stand  
In a house he built in the piny woods  
Where the ocean meets the land  
  
And it's hey ho, steady as you go  
Sing for the love of the land  
Hey ho, blessed is the home  
Born of the carpenter's hand  
  
Oh, his hair is rough and curly  
And his legs they reach the ground  
And his eyes are full of living  
And his back is broad and brown  
  
And his heart is sure and stubborn  
And his pride's too strong to bend  
And somewhere in his life  
He found the time to be my friend  
  
And it's hey ho, steady as you go  
Sing for the love of the land  
Hey ho, blessed is the home  
Born of the carpenter's hand  
  
Oh, he loves his sweet Rebekah  
He'll love her 'til his death  
And she gave to him a bonny son  
And they named the child Seth  
  
And now they are a family  
A community of three  
Living in the piny woods  
Where the soil meets the sea  
  
And it's hey ho, steady as you go  
Sing for the love of the land  
Hey ho, blessed is the home  
Born of the carpenter's hand  
Born of the carpenter's hand

So the story, it is told,  
Old John Sutter went to the mill site  
Found a piece of shining gold.  
  
Well, he took it to the city  
Where the word, like wildfire, spread.  
And old John Sutter soon came to wish he'd  
Left that stone in the river bed.  
  
For they came like herds of locusts  
Every woman, child and man  
In their lumbering Conestogas  
They left their tracks upon the land.  
  
[Chorus]  
Some would fail and some would prosper  
Some would die and some would kill  
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance  
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill.  
  
Well, they came from New York City,  
And they came from Alabam'  
With their dreams of finding fortunes  
In this wild unsettled land.  
  
Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows  
As they tried to cross the plains.  
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains  
With their hands froze to the reins.  
  
Oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, some pushed on to California  
And others stopped to take their rest.  
And by the Spring of Eighteen-sixty  
They had opened up the west.  
  
And then the railroad came behind them  
And the land was plowed and tamed,  
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker,  
He'd not one penny to his name.  
  
Oh...

And some would curse John Sutter's Mill  
Some men's thirsts are never filled.

And what she wants

I say leave  
When I mean stay  
But she don't see  
And so she moves away  
What we really want  
You know we rarely say  
Such is the language of love.  
  
It's tooth for tooth  
and eye for eye  
We hide our hearts  
And then we won't say why  
It's truth for truth  
and lie for lie  
Such is the language of love.  
  
One cries foul  
And will not speak  
The other claims a little victory  
And all the time  
You know we fail to see  
This is the language of love.  
  
When a loves begins to wander  
No one ever knows  
But we feel it deep inside us  
Long before it shows  
Long before it shows.  
  
We hem and haw  
We balk and bluff  
Our words don't ever seem to  
say enough  
But a simple smile  
A tender touch  
Speaks the true language of love.  
  
When a loves begins to wander  
No one ever knows  
But we feel it deep inside us  
Long before it shows  
Long before it shows.

Dan Fogelberg,The Last Nail,/d/dan+fogelberg/the+last+nail_20035708.html,"I saw you running ahead of the crowd  
I chased but never thought I'd catch you  
You said you loved me but you had to be free and I let you  
Why did I let you  
We walked together through the gardens and graves  
I watched you grow to be a woman  
Living on promises that nobody gave to no one  
They were given to no one  
I started listening to the wind and the rain  
You strained your ears but could hear nothing  
One night I thought I heard them whisper my name  
And I went running  
I left a trail of footprints deep in the snow  
I swore one day I would retrace them  
But when I turned around I found that the wind had erased them  
Now I'll never replace them  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fly away, my sweet bird, over the land  
Take life for all the freedom you can  
But if you ever should need a man  
Well, the offer still stands  
I hear you've taken on a husband and child  
And live somewhere in Pennsylvania  
I never thought you'd ever sever the string but I can't blame you none  
So let the ashes fall and lay where they will  
Just say that once you used to know me  
One last time sing that old song we used to know  
But this time sing  
But this time sing a little more slowly

Giving in to differences  
Straining to keep up appearances.  
  
Making believe the thread can be save  
You're aching to leave but  
Deathly afraid of letting go  
The threads entangled you so.  
  
Jealousies and legal fees  
Running away like two refugees  
Shadowed eyes and alibis  
Tell you too late you've been victimized.  
  
Freedom is near but seems to elude you  
Trying to change you dreams into  
What your needs allow  
It should be easy by now  
Why is love always the last to know?  
  
Falling back on better days  
Trying your damnedest to laugh  
You've thrown those childish dreams away  
It's over, you say, still you ask  
Why is love always the last to know?

And its lure on the unsuspecting  
It glitters and shines, it badgers and blinds  
And constantly needs protecting  
  
Balance the cost of the soul you lost  
With the dreams you lightly sold  
Are you under the power of gold?  
  
The letters and calls got you climbing the walls  
And everyone wants a favor  
They beg to remind you of times left behind you  
But you know the past is a loser  
  
The face you're wearing is different now  
And the days run hot and cold  
Are you under the power of gold?  
The power of gold  
  
You're a creature of habit, run like a rabbit  
Scared of a fear you can't name  
You own paranoia is looming before you  
But nobody thinks that it's a game  
  
Balance the cost of the soul you lost  
With the dreams you lightly sold  
Then tell me that you're free of the power of gold  
The power of gold  
  
The women are lovely, the wine is superb  
But there's something about the song that disturbs you

Rolling past a town  
Given no direction  
Just told to keep my head down  
As I took my position  
A man fired a gun  
I was so steeped in tradition  
That I could not run  
I was raised by a river  
Weaned upon the sky  
And in the mirror of the waters  
I saw myself learn to cry  
As my tears hit the surface  
I saw what had been done  
I gave feet to my freedom  
And I did run  
Someday later  
I saw the writing in the dust  
It told me how I should travel  
It told me who I was  
I ran far from the river  
Far as I could see  
And as the sun hit my shoulders  
I felt it burning me  
How I longed for the waters  
As the fire raged  
How I longed for the river  
As I aged  
I will die by a river  
As it rolls away  
Bury me in the nighttime  
Do not waste the day  
High above the waters  
That roll on to the sea  
All the angels in heaven  
Will laugh at me  
They will laugh at me  
My life was naught but a river  
Rolling through my brain  
Made of so many teardrops  
Made of so much pain

I've seen them go  
Off to the oilfields and rodeos

And the road's in your mind  
  
So many mountains before us  
So many rivers to cross  
Where is the wisdom to bring  
Back the vision we've lost  
  
Can we gaze with wonder of children  
Into the deafening night  
Has it gotten so dark  
That we cannot remember the light?  
  
When you sleep on the ground  
With the stars in your face  
You can feel the full length  
Of the beauty and grace  
In the wild places man  
Is an unwelcome guest  
But it's here than I'm found  
And it's here I feel blessed

Tonight let's do this thing  
All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours  
On our way here  
Tomorrow go back to being friends  
  
Go back to being friends  
Tonight let's be lovers, say you will  
And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love  
A thing or two I have to say here  
Tonight let's go all the way then  
Love I'll see you,  
Just for this evening  
Let's strip down, trip out at this  
One evening starts with a kiss  
Run away  
  
And tomorrow  
Back to being friends  
Lovers, love, lovers  
Just for tonight, one night, love you  
And tomorrow say goodbye

Dave Matthews Band,Seek Up,/d/dave+matthews+band/seek+up_20036570.html,"Sometimes I feel like I'm falling  
Fall back again, fall back again,  
Fall back again, fall back again  
  
Oh, life it seems a struggle between  
What we think what we see  
I'm not going to change my ways  
Just to please you or appease you  
Inside a crowd, five billion proud  
Willing to punch it out  
Right, wrong, weak, strong  
Ashes to ashes all fall down  
Look around about this round  
About this merry-go-round around  
If at all God's gaze upon us fall  
His mischievous grin, look at him  
  
Forget about the reasons and  
The treasons we are seeking  
Forget about the notion that  
Our emotions can be swept away  
Forget about being guilty,  
We are innocent instead  
For soon we will all find our lives swept away  
  
Sit awhile with TV's hungry child  
Big belly swelled  
Oh, for a price of a coke or a smoke  
Keep alive those hungry eyes  
Take a look at me, what you see in me,  
Mirror look at me  
Face it all, face it all again  
  
Forget about the reasons and  
The treasons we are seeking  
Forget about the notion that your emotions can be  
Swept away, kept at bay  
Forget about being guilty, I am innocent instead  
For soon we will all find our lives swept away  
  
You seek up an emotion  
And our cup is overflowing  
You seek up an emotion,  
Sometimes your well is dry  
You seek up a big monster  
For him to fight your wars for you  
But when he finds his way to you, the devil's not  
Going--ha, ha  
  
Say, say  
Look at me in my fancy car  
And my bank account  
Oh, how I wish I could take it all down  
Into my grave, I'd save  
Take a look again, take a look again,  
Take a look again  
Everyday things change,...stay the same  
  
Forget about the reasons and  
The treasons we are seeking  
Forget about the notion that  
Your emotions can be swept away  
Intentions are not wicked,  
Don't be tricked into thinking so  
Soon we will all find our lives swept away  
  
You seek up an emotion  
And our cup is overflowing  
You seek up an emotion,  
Sometimes your well is dry  
You seek up a big monster  
For him to fight your wars for you  
But when he finds his way to you,  
The devil's not going--ha, ha  
Fall back again, fall back again, fall back again...

I bent down to collect them  
And then she was gone

Oh, I came there to find out  
Find out she'd made up her mind, oh  
My arms are all tied up  
To me she was blind  
  
This space between us  
Where wingless dreams fall earless  
Will you not bear me witness  
With your back to me now  
  
It seemed so unnerving  
Still somehow deserving  
That she could hold my heart so tightly  
And still not see me here, oh

Knowing well I've had to take it till I make it to the top  
With the devil right behind me and my heart about to stop

Twenty years I was in prison more than that I was alone  
Some lily-white reporter thinks it's time that I was stoned  
Without sin he wrote the story and it chilled me to the bone  
Then he wondered why I lost my sense of humor  
I shaved my beard and cut my hair off it don't matter anyhow  
It was truth that told the answers to the questions up till now  
Crucify him someone shouted from the safety of the crowd  
Then they wondered why I lost my sense of humor  
Hey take them crosses from my doorstep there's no reason to my rhyme  
Everybody knows somebody will take care of me in time  
I made friends of all you stand for but the blind can't lead the blind  
Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of humor

Where she had a room on a cold second floor  
And that room looked like hell just a bed and a table  
A shade on the window and a lock on the door  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I'll stay for the night  
But I'll leave when it's early cause I've got this feeling  
She won't look so good in the bright morning light  
[ harmonica ]  
I've known some devils and I've known some angels  
I once had a woman on the Mexico line  
But I've never been touched like that woman touched me  
She lay there beside me and crawled in my mind  
And we talked and we smoked and made love till mornin'  
The sun come a streamin' through a hole in the shade  
And it fell like a spotlight on her face and her body  
And it hung like a halo round the bed where we lay  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I guess I'll stay for the night  
But I'll tell you boys that was five years ago and Lord God what a woman  
She still looks as good in the bright morning light

I said dance dance Dakota dance all around the country store  
Me and sweet Betty ain't never seen a bear that could dance before  
Well it's one step two steps three steps four  
A bottle of soda and he'll dance some more  
Dance dance Dakota dance all around the country store

I don't know what it was they was giving to him it had him pulling out his

I tried to keep time with the music Lord with the beat on my tamborine  
Gave him some wine from a Mason jar and we all began to sing

David Allan Coe,Desparados Waiting For A Train,/d/david+allan+coe/desparados+waiting+for+a+train_20586012.html,"By Guy Clark  
  
And I'd sing the red river valley  
And he'd sit in the kitchen and cry  
Run his fingers through seventy years of living'  
Wondering, lord, has every well I drilled ran dry  
We were friends, me and that old man  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
He's A drifter and A driller of oil wells  
And an old school man of the world  
Taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to  
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls  
And our lives was like some old western movie  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him  
To A place called the green frog cafe  
And there was old men with beer guts and dominoes  
Lying' about their lives while they played  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
And I looked up and he was pushing eighty  
And there was brown tobacco stains all down his chin  
To me he's one of the heroes of this country  
See why's he all dressed up like some old man  
Drinking' beer and playing' moon in forty-Two  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
The day before he dies I went to see him  
I was grown and he was almost gone  
We just closed our eyes and dreamt us up A kitchen  
And sang another verse to that old song  
""DON'T CRY, JACK, IT'S ONLY JESUS COMING""  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train

Honey, why can't you see me through me  
When I pretend that I'm to strong to bend?  
This heart can mend a lover or a friend  
Stop acting like you never knew me  
How you fantasize, telling little lies  
Fairy tales are all you ever see  
Don't you realize how you hypnotize  
Anyone who's fool enough to look back into your eyes?  
And fall in love with you  
If I ever wanted someone babe I need you now  
Please don't place your self above me  
Just out of reach when you could learn to teach  
Me to begin loving you again  
Why are you doing this to me?

David Allan Coe,Family Album,/d/david+allan+coe/family+album_20196872.html,"On Sunday after church there'd always be a picnic  
There'd be kinfolks callin' until dawn  
Me I'd play the guitar and my Uncle Merle would sing  
And grandpa he'd play that fiddle all night long  
Now the women folk they would work out in the kitchen  
You could smell that food for miles and miles around  
Paw he was prayin' my brother Jack would bring him down some moonshine  
Just so's that he could warsh those viddle down  
As soon as all the kids got tired of playin' horseshoes  
Mama she'd call me over to her side  
You know she'd say I'd like to take some pictures  
You could see her face light up with pride  
And then she'd bring out that worn out family album  
Its faded pictures some with corners torn  
She'd laugh and poin and tell me funny stories  
And look she'd say why that's the day that you were born  
And I'd sit and reminisce each picture with her  
And I'd listen to her laughter and her sighs  
But underneath I knew how much I'd hurt her  
For I'd put teardrops in my mama's eyes  
  
In my mama's eyes I've never done a wrong thing  
I was still a baby in my mama's eyes  
That old family album she'll keep on her night stand  
Right next to the Bible until the day she dies  
  
Through all those years in prison she stuck by me  
And she came to visit anytime she could  
Well I remember at my trial when she testified she loved me  
And she told the judge I'd always been so good  
Then later through the fame she watched me blossom  
From just a local country singer to a great big star  
She listened to all my records for the hidden meanings  
And she came to hear me sing in all those dim lit bars  
And she read all the things they wrote about me  
But she knew deep in her heart that it was lies  
No she don't hide her head in shame when someone says my name  
You'll find no teardrops in my mama's eyes  
In my mama's eyes...  
Right next to the Bible until the day she dies

David Allan Coe,If That Ain't Country - Part 2,/d/david+allan+coe/if+that+aint+country+part+2_20201885.html,"Well I'm just an old man now covered with scars  
Most of them I got fightin' in them redneck bars  
And A bunch of brand new tattoos that Squench put on me  
He covered up the ones I'd gotten years ago  
Back in prison when I was just Dave Coe  
And I wasn't famous then and I wasn't free  
You know I grew up in a three room run down shack  
At the foot of the hill by the railroad track  
Where decent folks don't go when the sun goes down  
My daddy worked at the Goodyear tire and rubber company  
And he worked on cars  
My momma went to church and my daddy went to bars  
Most people just called it the hillbilly part of town  
I had a '55 Chevy when I was fifteen  
I painted it red cause I was still green  
Hell I couldn't even afford to buy it gas  
Had A. 410 rifle and a bowie knife to  
Red Man tobacco that I liked to chew  
And we'd count the cars when the trains went past  
And if that ain't country i'll kiss your ass  
Chorus  
If that ain't country it'll hair lip the pope  
If that ain't country it's a damn good joke  
I've been on the Grand Ol Opry and I know Johnny Cash  
And if he ain't country i'll kiss your ass  
You know one of my sisters was a lady of the night  
Then one day she saw the light  
Now she don't do those things that she used to do  
She never made the funeral when my daddy died  
I said I'd forgive her but I guess I lied  
Cause there ain't no way to hide the way that I feel  
Me and my brothers took our sister Diane  
Down to the funeral home to see the old man  
Jimmy was the oldest and Diane she was the youngest one  
Jack and Ray was in the middle and then there was me  
And I'm the one that turned 23  
And grew up to be that yankee's rebel son  
Times are changing I heard Bob Dylan say  
It's been fifteen now since my father passed away  
But I can still picture him in his overalls  
Standin' around the house where he made his deals  
Around the porch there was a bunch of old wheels  
And some used Harley Davidson parts that he sold for cash  
There was fifty holes in an old tin roof  
Me and my family was livin' proof  
Everybody called us old poor white trash  
And if that ain't country i'll kiss your ass  
Chorus  
If that ain't country it'll hair lip the pope  
If that ain't country it's a damn good joke  
I've been on the Grand Ol Opry and I know Johnny Cash

Now Divers Do It Deeper must have really made them mad

And you can ride on the back of 'em with 'em

David Allan Coe,Just Divorced,/d/david+allan+coe/just+divorced_20225930.html,"Just divorced was written  
On the window of the car  
It looked like a tombstone  
Parked beside the local bar  
Once he'd drove it crazy  
Now he's driven it too far  
Just divorced was written  
On the window of the car  
  
Someone wrote in soap  
It's over right across the hood  
On the door it said good riddance  
Boy, I feel good  
On the fender were the words  
I won't be home tonight  
And the jukebox in the bar played  
If you're gonna do me wrong do it right  
Laughed so hard I thought now  
There's a guy who's got some spunk  
What a sense of humor  
It said goodbye on the trunk  
Tin cans tied with paper streamers  
Pointing to the bar  
Just divorced was written  
On the window of the car  
Just divorced was written...

David Allan Coe,Just To Prove My Love For You,/d/david+allan+coe/just+to+prove+my+love+for+you_20226545.html,"I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute  
Climb the Colorado mountains in the fall  
Crawl through Arizona like a flatland lizard  
If I thought it'd do me any good at all  
I could swim Lake Erie with my hands tied behind me  
Eat a West Virginia coal miner's shoes  
Drink the Mississippi River if it took a month of Sundays  
Just to prove my love for you  
I remember well the first time that I kissed you  
Cause the things ain't been the same ever since  
You got me thinkin' I could eat a ten penny nail And spit out a barbed wire
fence  
Now there ain't a livin' creature gonna ever come between us  
I'd fight lions snakes and gorillas too  
And if that ain't enough  
We'll start all over just to prove my love for you  
I could ride my pony through the eye of a hurricane  
Climb Mount Everest on a string  
Jump Niagara Falls in a burnin' barrel  
And bring you back a hoop smoke ring  
Wrestle alligators in the Okefenokee  
There's nothin' I wouldn't do  
If you just say the word I'll catch  
That Great Speckled Bird and bring it back to you  
I remember well the first time  
I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute

Yep, she finally crossed over lovers cheatin' line

Now listen to me, girl, it's true that I left her left her alone  
And some folks will tell you I done her wrong  
And I see the pity from all of my friends  
It's hard to believe, Lord, the way true love ends

Guess I should have noticed those old danger signs  
This bottles gonna help me to get her off my mind

raised her right an taught her how ta fuck when I asked her what he told her
shed said he'd never skold her he would always hold her but he never told her
much well he told her men were plain and simple told her love was like a
pimple once you squeez the juices out it just goes away he taught her how ta
hold on tighter and her taught her not to let men fight her and then there was
this poem he taught her on his dyin days

Don't put me in jail boys  
And if I make a little noise

I've been known to party some  
But I ain't never hurt no one  
I've been ashamed of what I've done  
Especially when I'm stoned  
  
I've spent most of my life in honest thinking  
And I never cared too much for serious drinking  
Marijuana makes my eyes start blinking  
And incense make my sinuses drain  
  
So, lay me down some rails boys  
Don't put me in jail boys  
And if I make a little noise  
Just leave me alone  
  
I've been known to party some  
But I ain't never hurt no one  
I've been ashamed of what I've done  
Especially when I'm stoned  
  
Now women make me think of consolation  
Prison makes me think of isolation  
Niggers made me vote for segregation  
And cocaine makes me hard as a rock  
  
So, lay me down some rails boys  
Don't put me in jail boys  
And if I make a little noise  
Just leave me alone  
  
I've been known to party some  
But I ain't never hurt no one  
I've been ashamed of what I've done  
Especially when I'm stoned  
  
Well it's hard to work for a dollar a week  
And the Ku Klux Klan is bigger  
So take the sheets of of your bed  
And let's go hang a nigger  
  
And lay me down some rails boys  
Don't put me in jail boys  
And if I make a little noise  
Just leave me alone

David Allan Coe,Revenge,/d/david+allan+coe/revenge_20585942.html,"Judy I feel weary now older than a man of thirty-three  
The gates of hell just opened after twenty years the warden says I'm free  
Revenge was all I wanted when I killed the man that took your life that day  
I've had my satisfaction but the price was more than love should have to pay  
Lords knows you weren't no lady and the witnesses all swore you was to blame  
And the way you teased the menfolk  
The jury all agreed you knew no shame knew no shame  
  
Well I'm glad that you can't see me now  
You'd probably say that I do not look my best  
Those lawyers took my money that Louisiana road gang took the rest  
And Judy I can't even conjure up your picture in my mind today  
Lately I've been thinkin' what a fool I was to love you anyway  
Lords knows you weren't no lady and the witnesses all swore you was to blame  
And the way you teased the menfolk the jury all agreed you knew no shame  
Well it all seems kinda useless as I place these flowers on your grave today  
I don't know what I'm doin' here I've forgotten all the things I came to say

At riding young wild horses for my pay  
But now I'm much too old it seems  
I only rides wild horses in his dreams

Oh midnight was the champion  
He is the only bronc I couldn't ride  
But now I hear old Midnights blind  
And rides little children for a dime  
Ladies used to hang around  
I must have been a hero in their eyes  
My silver spurs are rusted now  
Lord, I wished I tried to settle down

You knew my fishing pole  
When I was eight years old  
And river you never told me lies

Your muddy water makes me feel alone  
River you keep flowing  
Like you know just where you're going  
But river will you ever take me home  
  
River I'm not proud of what I've done  
Somehow my fishing pole became a gun  
Through these prison bars I see  
That you're still running free  
But river I've got no place to run  
River I can see you from my window  
Your muddy water makes me feel alone  
River you keep flowing  
Like you know just where you're going  
But river will you ever take me home

We've got to slow down - come down  
We got to get off of this merry-Go-Round  
  
Where did you go, marilyn monroe  
If you see james dean, tell him I said hello  
Janis sang here, jimmy did too  
They're saving A place there for me and you  
There's gonna be A rock and roll holiday  
We've got to get there in time to play  
  
Tune up the fiddle, rosin the bow  
We could be the only country band on A rock and roll show  
We've got to get up, no time to hit up  
There's another crowd waiting for the music to play  
  
Slow down - come down  
Don't take A ride on death's merry-Go-Round

Cause there's a lady who's mine and she's not the kind to just die upon the
vine  
Rose knows something's going on Rose knows she's spending too much time alone  
I suppose better get myself back home Rose knows something's going on  
  
I'd love to stay here and lay down with you dear and hold you one more time  
I wish it could be but unfortunately I've got roses on my mind  
Rose knows something's going on  
Rose knows something's going on
