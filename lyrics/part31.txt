David Allan Coe,San Francisco Mabel Joy,/d/david+allan+coe/san+francisco+mabel+joy_20585939.html,"My daddy was an honest man, just a redneck Georgia farm boy  
My momma spent her short life, raisin' kids and bailin' hay  
And I was just fifteen when I ached inside to wonder  
So I hoped a freight in Waycross and I rode it to L.A.  
  
Well, I met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Maybel Joy  
Destitution's child, born on a L.A. street called Shane  
And sleep came and left this little Waycross Georgia country boy  
Maybel Joy was gone, Lord, I'd never see her again  
  
Growin' up came quietly in the arms of Maybel Joy  
Laughter found our morning's, brought new meaning to my life  
I woke up one day, Lord to find that I was by myself  
With dreams of Georgia cotton and California wine  
  
Sunday mornin' found me standin' 'neath the red-light of her door  
Right 'cross sent me reelin', laid me face down on the floor  
In place of Maybel Joy I found a merchant mad marine  
Who said, ""Your Georgia neck is red but son you're still green""  
  
Well, I turned twenty one in gray rock federal prison  
The judge, he had no mercy on this Waycross, Georgia boy  
Sometimes at night in silence, Lord, I'd listen  
That same old freight to take me back to Maybel Joy  
  
Cold nights had no pity on this Waycross, Georgia farm boy  
Springtime turned to summer and then the winter came  
Starin' at those four gray walls in silence, Lord, I'd listen  
Somewhere in the distance to the whistle of the train  
  
Sunday morning found me lying 'neath the red light of her door  
With a bullet in my side I cried, ""Have you seen Maybel Joy?""  
Stunned and shaken someone said, ""Son, she don't live here no more""  
She left this town ten years ago, I heard she's looking for  
Some Georgia farm boy""

David Allan Coe,Seven Mile Bridge,/d/david+allan+coe/seven+mile+bridge_20585938.html,"You know as a child, he heard tell of the seven mile bridge  
That connected on marathon shore  
Yes and it was the gateway key west his grandpa  
Had told him ten times or more  
The stories of some sailors curse on the bridge  
Where it opens to let the boats through  
But the natives all laugh at grandpas old stories  
And swear that it just isn't true  
Now most of them sail across to Miami  
From the edge of the blue water line  
With craw fish and snappers to sell at the market  
For money to spend on some wine  
They always cross through at the seven mile bridge  
Except when the moon comes out full  
They're not superstitious they tell you as they are  
Repeating that old seaman's rule  
Watch out for those outlaws and pirates  
Lord knows that they'll steal you blind  
Don't mess around with those cutthroats and thieves  
They're robbers and killers of time  
And there's nothing worse than an old sailors curse  
On the seven mile bridge where you find  
They're stealing the future and making believe  
The past is still somewhere behind  
The seven mile bridge, the seven mile bridge  
And he found a woman who'd come here from Cuba  
She gave him a son and a dream  
They lived in a conch house somewhere on stock island  
With the seven mile bridge in between  
She'd spent her nights on the window walk wondering  
If he'd safely pull through the storm  
While he spent his money on painted up women  
And whiskey to keep his blood warm  
Then he'd gamble on crab races till he was broke  
While she sat up waiting all night  
Then felling too guilty to face her and tell her  
He'd look for some bully to fight  
At the end of the rainbow where the sun always shines  
Just south of the seven mile bridge  
She waits at the window for signs of his sailboat  
And tries not to worried the kids  
She sneaks a few drinks from the bottle she hides  
From a husband that's to tired to think  
With feelings of guilt she picks up the bottle  
And pours the remains in the sink  
Now she thinks of the men that stare at her boldly  
They know she's a woman alone  
With fingers that tremble she touches her body  
And wishes her man would come home  
Now the years pass so quickly for time is a thief  
His skin looks like leather by now  
His woman's got fat and lost all he  
But, Lord, she's lived up to her vow  
She looks at her son that's going on twenty  
He's ready to live his own life  
She hopes he can find a sea worthy woman  
A sailor sure needs a good wife  
Why he's just like his daddy  
She thinks as she watches  
Him weaving those fish nets all day  
Knowing that some time the seven mile bridge  
Will take him and lead him astray  
He might return his woman would learn  
Broke like his daddy and drunk  
She wrote down some words on an old piece of sail cloth  
Nailed it over his bunk  
Why then, she packed his sea bag and filled up his trunk  
His new wife would want it that way  
Just before the old man shook the younger lads hand  
These are the words he did say

David Allan Coe,Shackles And Chains,/d/david+allan+coe/shackles+and+chains_20585937.html,"  
On a long lonesome journey I am going  
So my sweet little darling don't cry  
For in shackles and chains they will take me  
To a prison to live till I die  
(chorus)  
And each night threw the bars  
I will gaze at the stars  
My dreams dear of you so in vain  
A piece of stone I will use for my pillow  
While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains  
Put your arms threw these bars once more darling  
Let me kiss your sweet lips I love best  
For in sorrow they were my conculution  
And in sadness my haven of rest  
(repeat chorus)

Six Days on the Road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.  
Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye.  
I could have a lot of women, but I'm not like some other guys.  
I could have one to hold me tight,  
But I could never make believe it's alright.  
Six Days on the Road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.  
Well the ICC is a checkin' on down the line.  
I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind.  
Nothin' bothers me tonight, I can dodge all the scales alright.  
Six Days on the Road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.  
Got a ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive.  
I'm takin' little white pills and my eyes are open wide.

Bad times, all pass with the wind  
Your hand in mine, steal the thunder  
You make the sun wanna shine  
  
I followed you down each and every road, babe  
I picked wild flower, sung you soft, sad song  
And every road we took, I know, your search was for the truth  
And this storm that's brewin' now won't last long  
  
Storms never last, do they, baby?

David Allan Coe,Suicide,/d/david+allan+coe/suicide_20585929.html,"Standing in the bathroom with a gun in my hand  
Pulling on the trigger just as fast as I can  
I can hear her scream as she reaches for the lover beside her  
Married by the Bible, she was only sixteen  
  
I was fresh from prison trying to follow my dream  
Who'd ever thought I'd be the judge and the jury that tried her?  
Blood splattered all over the wall  
The gun still smoking as I watch it fall  
  
I run through the door while the sirens blow out on the highway  
Maybe they'll catch me and maybe they won't  
It really doesn't matter I just had to do things my way  
Yeah, yeah, I might just commit suicide, yeah, yeah  
  
He's the only man that I trusted with my life  
I can't understand why he ran off with my wife  
Now that they're dead what's gonna happen to the baby?  
The state will have to raise her just the way they did me  
  
Her mother wanted freedom and I just set her free  
She should have never let me see that she was no longer a lady  
She called out my name just before she died  
She swore she loved me and I almost cried  
  
With trembling hands I reached out and tried to save her  
Cheating is something I can understand  
But not when it's cheating with my best friend  
She betrayed the love and the baby I gave her

Take time to know her  
  
I found a woman, one I knew I truly love  
She was everything, I'd ever been dreaming of  
And she was bad, I didn't know it  
Her pretty smile never did show it  
All I knew is what I could see  
And I knew I wanted her for me  
  
I took her home to mama  
Mama wanted to see my future bride  
She looked at us both  
Then she called me to her side  
  
She said, ""Take time to know her  
It's not an overnight thing  
Take time to know her  
Son don't rush into this thing""  
  
But I didn't listen to my mama  
I went straight down to the church  
I just couldn't wait to have that little girl of mine  
I couldn't even wait till I got home from work  
The preacher was there, so was my future bride  
He looked at us both and then he called me to his side  
  
He said, ""Son take time to know her  
It's not an overnight thing  
Take time to know her  
Please don't rush into this thing""  
  
But it looked like every thing  
It looked like everything was gonna be all right  
Then I came home from work a little early one night  
When I walked in the house, I saw her there  
She was kissin' on another man and I knew right then  
I knew right then what my mama meant  
When she took me by the hand  
  
She said, ""Son take time to know her  
Boy it's not an overnight thing  
Take time to know her  
There's no reason for you to rush into this thing""  
  
Take time to know her  
It's not, love is not an easy thing  
Take time to know her  
Boy please don't rush into this thing  
Take time to know her

I had my guitar on my back  
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac  
He was dress like 1950  
Half drunk and hollow eyed  
He said its a long walk to Nashville would you like a ride son  
  
Well I sat down in the front seat  
He turned on the radio  
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold  
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale  
When I asked him for a light  
And I knew there was something strange about this ride  
  
[Chorus]  
He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing  
Have you paid your dues?  
Can you moan the blues?  
Can you bend them guitar strings?  
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?  
'Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride  
  
Well he cried just south of Nashville  
And he turned that car around  
He said this is where you get off boy  
I'm goin' back to Alabam  
And as I stepped outta that Cadillac  
I said mister many thanks  
He said you don't have to call me mister mister  
The whole world calls me Hank

Divorcing my mama to live with a dream

You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled

David Bowie,A Foggy Day,/d/david+bowie/a+foggy+day_10080941.html,"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town where the people I knew  
I had the feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've ever known  
A foggy day in a london town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The british museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles had'nt passed  
For suddenly I saw you there  
And through foggy london town the sun was shining everywhere

David Bowie,African Night Flight,/d/david+bowie/african+night+flight_20036814.html,"African nightmare one-time Mormon  
More men fall in Hullabaloo men  
I slide to the nearest bar  
Undermine chairman I went too far  
Bent on a windfall rent a sony  
Wonder how the dollar went down  
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father  
Hey no, he wished me well  
  
Seemed like another day  
I could fly into the eye of god on high  
  
His burning eye will see me through  
One of these days, one of these days  
Gotta get a word through one of these days  
  
Asanti habari habari habari  
Asanti nabana nabana nabana  
  
Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight  
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing  
Bare strip takeoff skimming over Rhino  
Born in slumber less than peace  
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming  
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine  
Sick of you, sick of me  
Lust for the free life  
Quashed and maimed  
Like a valuable loved one  
Left unnamed  
  
Seemed like another day  
I could fly into the eye of god on high  
  
Seemed like another day  
I could fly into the eye of god on high  
  
Over the bushland over the trees  
Wise like Orangutan that was me

Sunshine on the wasteland  
Old man sitting in the white sand  
Think we're in for a big surprise  
Right between the eyes  
  
Seemed a good idea  
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here  
Only one man could be seen  
And he was old and so serene  
Captain sat in his deck chair  
And the red light flashed Beware  
Pilot felt quite big-time  
As the bomb sailed through the air  
Well, they danced and sang  
When the bang went bang  
When the lights popped out  
And the smoke began to clear  
It was positively queer

""Die"" said the General  
""Cobblers"" said the man  
So the Pentagon sent a cable  
And the Queen a telegram  
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones  
Ripped apart that sand  
'Til the stench was just revolting  
And the sky a greenish tan  
But the soldier said ""Sir,  
There's a crack in the world""  
And the figures went ""squash"",  
And the bits flew far and wide  
How the universe sighed!

When the smoke had blown away  
There was nothing left to view  
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you  
Floating high up in the sky

The dream is gone

To ease my mind  
To find out what's gnawing at me  
Wouldn't think, to look at me,  
That I've spent a lot of time in education  
It all seems so long ago  
I'm a thinker, not a talker  
I've no-one to talk to, anyway  
  
I can't see the road  
For the rain in my eyes  
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh  
  
I live above the grocers store,  
Owned by an Austrian  
He often calls me down to eat  
And he jokes about his broken English,  
Tries to be a friend to me  
But for all my years  
Of reading conversation,  
I stand without a word to say  
  
I can't see the bridge  
For the rain in my eyes  
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh  
  
And the world is full of life  
Full of folk who don't know me  
And they walk in twos or threes or more  
While the light  
That shines above the grocer's store  
Investigates my face so rudely  
And my essays lying  
Scattered on the floor  
Fulfill their needs just by being there  
And my hands shake, my head hurts,  
My voice sticks inside my throat  
I'm invisible and dumb  
No-one will recall me  
  
And I can't see the water  
Through the tears in my ey-y-yes  
Ahhh-huh, h... Uh, huh

But no-one knows about your low-life  
I know a way to find a situation  
And hold a candle to your high-life disguise  
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door  
That was no ordinary stick-up

David Bowie,Cygnet Committee,/d/david+bowie/cygnet+committee_20036930.html,"I bless you madly,  
Sadly as I tie my shoes  
I love you badly,  
Just in time, at times, I guess  
Because of you I need to rest  
Because it's you  
That sets the test  
  
So much has gone  
And little is new  
And as the sparrow sings  
Dawn chorus for  
Someone else to hear  
The Thinker sits alone growing older  
And so bitter  
  
""I gave Them life  
I gave Them all  
They drained my very soul  
...Dry  
I crushed my heart  
To ease their pains  
No thought for me remains there  
Nothing can they spare  
What of me?  
Who praised their efforts  
To be free?  
Words of strength and care  
And sympathy  
I opened doors  
That would have blocked their way  
I braved their cause to guide,  
For little pay  
  
I ravaged at my finance just for those  
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility  
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free  
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""  
  
I bless you madly,  
Sadly as I tie my shoes  
I love you badly, just in time,  
At times, I guess  
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes  
Because it's you  
That sets the test  
  
So much has gone  
And little is new  
And as the sunrise stream  
Flickers on me,  
My friends talk  
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word  
  
""We had a friend, a talking man  
Who spoke of many powers that he had  
Not of the best of men, but ours  
  
We used him  
We let him use his powers  
We let him fill our needs  
Now we are strong  
  
And the road is coming to its end  
Now the damned have no time to make amends  
No purse of token fortune stands in our way  
The silent guns of love  
Will blast the sky  
We broke the ruptured structure built of age  
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage  
  
Where money stood  
We planted seeds of rebirth  
And stabbed the backs of fathers  
Sons of dirt  
  
Infiltrated business cesspools  
Hating through our sleeves  
Yea, and we slit the Catholic throat  
Stoned the poor  
On slogans such as  
  
'Wish You Could Hear'  
'Love Is All We Need'  
'Kick Out The Jams'  
'Kick Out Your Mother'  
'Cut Up Your Friend'  
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'  
  
And we know the flag of love is from above  
And we can force you to be free  
And we can force you to believe""  
  
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain  
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain  
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain  
It said:  
""I believe in the power of good  
I believe in the state of love  
I will fight for the right to be right  
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right""  
  
And I open my eyes to look around  
And I see a child laid slain  
On the ground  
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows  
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command  
But not hearing anymore  
Not hearing anymore  
Just the shrieks from the old rich  
  
And I want to believe  
In the madness that calls 'Now'  
And I want to believe  
That a light's shining through  
Somehow  
  
And I want to believe  
And you want to believe  
And we want to believe  
And we want to live  
Oh, we want to live  
  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live  
  
I want to live  
I want to live  
I want to live  
  
I want to live  
I want to live  
I want to live

And die, and lie beside  
She is the apple in my eye  
She talked to God  
I couldn't cope or'd hope eloped  
A dope she roped this salty lie  
And when she's dreaming, I believe  
And when she's reading, I retreat  
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again  
Telling me she's dead against it  
And deep my wound  
Within for every second chance it was thy tore  
From deep within despite the rain  
My words are worn  
She loves to talk into the phone  
No matter who, no matter when  
No matter where  
No better than the faulty line  
And when she's dreaming, I believe  
And when she's reading, I retreat  
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again  
Telling me she's dead against it

Shaking their sex and their bones  
And the boys that we were  
An alien nation in therapy  
Sliding naked and new

Todd Browning's freak you was  
  
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee

David Bowie,Future Legend,/d/david+bowie/future+legend_20036724.html,"And in the death,  
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy  
Thoroughfare,  
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building,  
High on Poacher's Hill.  
And red, mutant, eyes gaze down on Hunger City.  
No more big wheels.  
  
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats,  
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes,  
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers,  
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue.  
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now leg-warmers.  
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald.  
Any day now,  
The year of the Diamond Dogs.

This is Genocide.""

In the shadow I'll clip your wings  
And I'll tell you I love you  
In the heat of the morning  
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze  
Light my candle from the sun  
I'll give you daylight for a friend  
I'll do all of these  
I'll prove that it can be done, oh, I'm so much in love  
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind  
No man loved like I love you  
Wouldn't you like to love me too  
In the heat of the morning  
In the shadow I'll clip your wings  
And I'll tell you I love you  
In the heat of the morning  
In the heat of the morning  
In the shadow I'll clip your wings  
And I'll tell you I love you

David Bowie,It Ain't Easy,/d/david+bowie/it+aint+easy_20036910.html,"When you climb to the top of the mountain  
Look out over the sea  
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be  
Then you jump back down to the rooftops  
Look out over the town  
Think about all of the strange things circulating round  
  
[CHORUS]  
It ain't easy, it ain't easy  
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down  
  
Well all the people have got their problems  
That ain't nothing new  
With the help of the good Lord  
We can all pull on through  
We can all pull on through  
Get there in the end  
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again  
  
[CHORUS]  
  
Satisfaction, satisfaction  
Keep me satisfied  
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman  
She calling from inside  
She's a-calling from inside  
Trying to get to you  
All the woman really wants you can give her something  
Too

David Bowie,It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City,/d/david+bowie/its+hard+to+be+a+saint+in+the+city_20037015.html,"I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra  
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova  
I could walk like Brando right into the sun  
Then dance just like a Casanova  
With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet  
Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat  
When I strut down the street I could hear its heartbeat  
The sisters fell back and said ""Don't that man look pretty""  
The cripple on the corner cried out ""Nickels for your pity""  
Them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty  
It's so hard to be a saint in the city  
  
I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash  
I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash  
I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everything cool  
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose  
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground  
The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street  
Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat  
I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat  
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street  
  
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead  
As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead  
They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread  
But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat  
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your
seat  
Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet  
Then you're outta that hole and back up on the street  
  
And them South Side sisters sure look pretty  
The cripple on the corner cries out ""Nickels for your pity""  
And them downtown boys sure talk gritty  
It's so hard to be a saint in the city

Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now

Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds  
I will show you a game where the winner never wins  
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you  
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key  
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals  
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger  
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free  
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together  
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you  
Your darkened eyes throw mystery  
But your lips are void of history  
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you  
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear  
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you

What can we do?  
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do.  
So I've been writing just for you.  
  
They say your life is going very well.  
They say you sparkle like a different girl.  
But something tells me that you hide  
When all the world is warm and tired.  
You cry a little in the dark,  
Well so do I.  
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say,  
But I can see it's not okay.  
  
He makes you laugh.  
He brings you out in style.  
He treats you well  
And makes you up real fine.  
And when he's strong,  
He's strong for you.  
And when you kiss  
It's something new.  
But did you ever call my name  
Just by mistake?  
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do.  
So I'll just write some love to you.

He brought them presents with every coins he made

Asked him for his name

Were they just a game?

David Bowie,Lover To The Dawn,/d/david+bowie/lover+to+the+dawn_20037029.html,"And as the sparrow sings  
Dawn chorus for  
Someone else to hear  
The thinker sits alone growing older  
And so bitter  
She gave them life,  
She gave them all  
They drained her very soul dry...dry  
Hey hey hey bitter girl  
We're out to sitting here digging you  
We flew done here just to figure you  
It's easy  
Don't be so bitter  
Oh oh oh crazy girl  
You gave too much and you got nothing  
Too many problems and not one thing  
In return  
Left high and dry  
Door  
And as the sun rise stream  
Flickers on  
She finds lavender  
To fight the beckoning

David Bowie,Loving The Alien,/d/david+bowie/loving+the+alien_20036950.html,"Watching them come and go  
The templars and the saracens  
They're traveling the holy land  
Opening telegrams  
  
Torture comes and torture goes  
Knights who'd give you anything  
They bear the cross of coeuf de leon  
Salvation for the mirror blind  
  
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky  
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear  
Prayers they hide the saddest view  
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)  
And your prayers they break the sky in two  
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)  
You pray til the break of dawn  
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)  
And you'll believe you're loving the alien  
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)  
  
Thinking of a different time  
Palestine a modern problem  
Bounty and your wealth in land  
Terror in a best laid plan  
  
Watching them come and go  
Tomorrows and the yesterdays  
Christians and the unbelievers  
Hanging by the cross and nail

David Guetta,If We Ever,/d/david+guetta/if+we+ever_20899431.html,"I've been fragile for a long time  
A big old hole inside my heart  
And I was searching through the valley  
Stumbled on love in the dark  
  
Was afraid to try but afraid to never know  
What it feels like to be loved  
Had a hill to climb  
But the places we could go  
Oh, I gotta know  
  
So if we ever, fell in love  
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh  
So if we ever, fell in love  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I was empty, it was all gone  
The birds would sing but made no sound  
Till I met you, found I was all wrong  
You picked me up right off the ground  
  
Was afraid to try, and afraid I'd fall again  
Crashing down from the sky, you know  
Had a hill to climb, but with you my heart wont mend  
That's the one thing, we all wanna know  
  
So if we ever, fell in love  
Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh  
So if we ever fell in love  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I just wanna know, I just wanna know  
Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know  
  
I just wanna know, I just wanna know  
Tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know

I believe in the wonder,  
I believe I can touch the flame,  
There's a spell that I'm under,  
Got to fly, I don't feel no shame,  
  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
  
Take a look what you've started,  
In the world flashing from your eyes,  
And you know that you've got it,  
From the thunder you feel inside,  
I believe in a feeling,  
Of the pain that you left to die,  
I believe in the livin'  
In life that you give to try,  
  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
Mine,  
Mine,  
The world is mine,  
  
I've lost my fear to what appears,  
I do my best,  
The world is mine,  
You take the price and realize,  
That's in your eyes,  
The world is mine,  
I've lost my fear to what appears,  
I do my best,  
The world is mine,  
You take the price and realize,  
That's in your eyes,  
The world is mine,  
  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine

I open my eyes, and there you are again

It ain't my fault, but still I take the blame  
You, you, you  
In my mind I already know  
You, you, you  
But my heart don't wanna let it go  
  
I don't wanna think about you

It ain't my fault, but still I take the blame  
You, you, you  
In my mind I gotta face it  
You, you, you  
But my heart is badly aching  
  
I don't wanna think about you

So let's keep living till it all falls down  
Let's close our eyes  
And let the moment drown the whole world out

Hear our hearts beat together!  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever!

We won't surrender, there's no standing down (no standing down)  
Love's a playing field (oh no)  
It's full of winners, we're breaking new ground

How love indeed  
And when just floating  
Searching infinity

David Guetta,What I Did For Love,/d/david+guetta/what+i+did+for+love_21091490.html,"[Verse 1]  
Talking loud, talking crazy  
Locked me outside  
Praying for the rain to come  
Bone dry again  
Guess it's true what they say  
I'm always late  
Say you need a little space  
And I'm in your way  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It hurts, but I remember every scar  
And I've learnt that living is the hardest part  
I can't believe what I did for love  
I can't believe what I did for us, oh  
Crash and we burn into flames  
Stitch myself up and I'd do it again  
I can't believe what I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
[Chorus]  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm a fool for your games  
But I'd always play  
Can't admit it was a waste  
Just too much at stake  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It hurts, but I remember every scar  
And I've learnt that living is the hardest part  
I can't believe what I did for love

Crash and we burn into flames  
Stitch myself up and I'd do it again

That's just the way it goes  
Feels like I've waited so long for this  
I wonder if it shows  
  
Head under water

It never felt so good  
'Cause I can feel it coming over me  
I wouldn't stop it if I could

Give me a reason  
I gotta know  
Do you feel it too?  
Can't you see me here on overload  
And this time I blame you  
Looking out for you to hold my hand  
It feels like I could fall  
Now love me right, like I know you can  
We could lose it all

Can you please tell me,  
Where she's gone.  
  
She was my stare this eve,  
A very breath of me.  
How could I let her walk away  
Christmas star, tell her I'm sorry,  
Hope to guide her journey home this day.

If she could just hear me now,  
If I could just tell her I care  
And hold her again in my arms.

If she's falling in love or dreaming her dream,  
Felling lonesome like me.  
  
I should be strong, I know.  
Should try and let her go  
But I'd give my life if I could just believe  
You'll be sending my love back home, this Christmas  
Eve.

If I could just tell her I care  
And hold her again in my arms.

She would know from my eyes just how precious we were,  
  
If only I could reach her.  
  
And so old friend up there  
If you can hear my prayer  
Won't you try and help this lonely man believe,  
You'll be sending my love back home, this Christmas  
Eve.

All to grab her in my arms again,  
I'd give my life, my soul,

Send her home to me, this day.  
  
It ain't christmas without her.  
And without her,  
It could never be christmas again...
