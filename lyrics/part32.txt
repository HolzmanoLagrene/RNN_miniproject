Would feel the way that I do  
Baby it's you  
Who fills up my life  
And if you walked away from me today  
Never to return until the journey  
That you made had ended  
I know you planned it  
Just to fill up my life  
  
Fill my life  
Till now  
No one's been able to show me how  
To fill my life like you  
You are the woman who taught me to  
  
And if you walked away from me today  
It wouldn't change a thing  
I'd still be singing celebration of you  
Baby you do  
You fill up my life  
  
Fill my life  
Now I know  
What it feels like to overflow  
Until my life is through  
All I'm here for is here for you  
  
Fill my life  
Now I see  
What it feels like to be set free  
Until my life is through  
All I'm here for  
Is here for you  
Just for you  
Only for you  
Hey hey...oooo

To give us another try  
  
And if all these plans i made  
Don't melt the lady's heart,  
I'll put on the old forty-fives  
  
And maybe the old songs,  
Will bring back the old times,  
Maybe the old lines will sound new.  
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder,  
Maybe old feelings will some through  
Maybe we'll start to cry,  
And wonder why, we ever walked away  
  
Maybe the old songs,  
Will bring back the old times  
And make her want to stay, oh oh  
  
It's been too long without  
Seeing her face light up  
When I come home.  
Been to many hours I've waited  
Staring at the phone  
  
Sweet old songs I'm counting on you  
Bring her back to me  
I'm tired of listening alone  
  
Maybe the old songs,  
Will bring back the old times,  
Maybe the old lines will sound new.

Show me the way  
Though this loneliness  
Then you came into view  
And from that night I knew  
I'll love you over and over again  
I'll hold you close to my heart  
For every lifetime  
Now and forever I promise you  
To the end  
I'll love you over and over again  
  
Ev'ry time I look into your eyes  
And you smile  
It just amazes me  
How two people made of flesh and bone  
Get to be shown  
Such sweet eternity  
  
Let the mountains tumble, let 'em fall  
Through it all  
I'll be by your side  
And until time grows old  
With all my heart and soul  
  
I'll love you over and over again

Before she sees that I've been  
Up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again  
All around, tryin' to get the feeling again  
The one that made me shiver  
Make my knees start to quiver  
Every time she walks in  
  
And I've looked high, low  
Everywhere I possibly can  
But there's just no tryin' to get the feelin' again  
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came  
  
Read ev'ry book  
Looked  
Through every meditation and poem  
Just to bring home  
That old sweet sensation  
But it ain't no use to me  
To try to get that feeling again  
  
Where did it run to?  
I thought I'd done all that I could  
Just to keep the love burnin'  
  
I've been up, down  
Tryin' to get the feeling

On that enchanted train  
The passing scenery didn't get a glance  
We held hands completely light hearted  
Off to a winter romance  
  
We danced that night by candle light  
The world was white with snow  
The way we felt we never felt  
The snow could melt and go  
But though the snow is gone the romance lingers on  
And those that said it didn't stand a chance  
Will know when they see us together  
That love's not been controlled by the weather  
And all of our summers we'll have our winter romance

But it can't see or come to me  
When I call your name  
I realize it's just a picture in a frame  
  
I read your letters  
When you're not here  
But they don't move me  
And they don't groove me  
Like when I hear your sweet voice  
Whispering in my ear  
  
Don't you know

Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no  
  
I play my game of fantasy  
And I pretend that I'm not in reality  
I need the shelter of  
Your arms to comfort me  
  
No other sound is quite  
The same as your name  
No touch can do half as much  
To make me feel better  
So let's stay together  
  
I've got the memories  
To look back on and though  
They help me when you're gone  
I'm well aware, nothing can  
Take the place of your being there  
  
So glad we've got the real thing, baby  
So glad we've got the real thing, oh darling  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing

You can comb through the Rome coliseum  
And the rear of your nearest museum  
There's the Mona Lisa, the Tower of Pisa  
A cowhand's daughter out in Texas  
And there's modern art to see  
That makes you wonder  
What the heck is meant to be  
On the streets of Murmark there's a fancy kind of art that is strictly for the  
Tourists from the sticks  
And those wise Greenwich guys really open up your eyes painting portraits of  
Their pretty little chicks  
So to each creator and imitator who daubs and dabbles with the brushes  
To the guys that draw their bunnies or the Sunday morning funnies  
And brighten up the world today  
And to every girl that poses to every Grandma Moses  
We like to tip the old beret

Can I still be asleep on the couch there  
  
Can this girl be really here

Or does she know me the way I think the way that I drink the fact that I slept
all year

Whispering pretty stories I long to hear once more  
Strolling with my girlie where the dew is pearly early in the morning

But the love light that lies  
Within my baby's eyes  
How it lies, how it lies  
How it lies  
  
Oh, her name tops the list of every florist  
Her beaus stand ten deep in line  
With all of the trees in the forest  
Why should I be the only clinging vine?  
  
Oh, there's heartbreak in store  
Where the one that you adore  
Is a devil  
In the angel disguise  
  
But the love light that lies  
Is the love light that dies  
How it lies, how it lies  
How it lies

Multidimesional mind, try and wash the  
""Evil"" from your mind and open it.  
  
When you taste the truth you will  
See like others before me, to you  
I am past, a story to tell  
Tell it.  
  
You may think you own the end  
Take another close look at the script  
  
Of sadness etched in the book.

In mysterious ways  
You draw me in  
To a love  
Beyond all understanding  
  
Beyond my reach  
So far away  
But it seems  
Like only yesterday  
  
I'm Haunted  
Haunted  
Is that what you wanted  
  
All that's left  
Is the ghost of your smile  
It stays awhile  
Then fades away  
  
I hear your footsteps on the ground  
Tempting me to turn around  
It's just the echo  
Of a disenchanted lover  
Shuffling aimlessly  
Homeward bound  
  
To empty rooms  
And picture frames  
And Friends  
Who can't recall our names  
  
I'm Haunted  
Haunted  
Is that what you wanted  
  
All that's left  
Is the ghost of your smile  
It stays awhile

You make me feel like  
A mad dog  
I got nothing to lose  
Mad dog  
You got nothing I can use  
Mad dog  
Howling at the moon  
A mad dog  
  
She said a hard man is good to find  
And then she raised a doubt  
All that I could give she took  
And then she threw me out  
Well I don't care  
I don't care anymore  
I'm going to lose my grip  
I'm going to let it rip  
  
You make me feel like  
A mad dog  
I got nothing to lose  
Mad dog  
You got nothing I can use  
Mad dog  
Howling at the moon  
A mad dog

There ain't nothin' I need.  
I took all till I had more,  
I'm always takin' the lead.  
  
Old man shakin' dice down on the street,  
Try'n to make a livin' somehow  
But I'm really sure about gettin' things sorted out  
And I'm gettin' ready right now.  
  
You can't hold me,  
I have told you.  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life.  
  
I've been called by many names  
And all of them are bad.  
I can take it all the same,  
It's all I've ever had.  
  
I've got somethin' that you can't get  
But one thing you can see:  
Gettin' there ain't easy  
But it sure was hard for me.  
  
You can't hold me,  
I have told you.  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life.  
  
Every time I take a look  
There's someone close behind.  
They never used to make a pass,  
The things that crossed their minds.  
  
Now they tell me that it's all right  
And they want to be my friend.  
They're ridin' on my back.  
When is it goin' to end?  
  
You can't hold me,  
I have told you.  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life,  
Might just take your life.

Maybe I won't even try

I see you coming  
With that look in your eye  
You act like a king but you ain't got a thing  
In your mind  
  
And now there's nobody home  
My belly is aching  
Your image is blown  
Your lights are burning bright  
But nobody's home  
  
You talk about love and affection  
If only you could  
You're full of pride but there's nothing inside  
And you think you're so good  
  
You know you got it coming to ya  
All things return  
You need me  
It's not gonna be my concern  
  
And now there's nobody home  
Your message is changing  
The children have grown  
Your lights are burning bright  
But nobody's home  
  
I hear you crying  
What can I say  
You get what you give so  
Forgive me as I turn away  
  
Nobody's home  
A legend is dying  
The seeds have been sown  
Your lights are burning bright  
But nobody's home

I don't know how long it'll last

When I wake up tomorrow, I'll be looking around for you  
I got no reason to be down at the station  
I got no ticket, but I'm gonna take a fucking ride  
Don't care where I go  
I never seem to know  
I never had a penny, but I never wondered why  
Oh no, I never wondered why  
  
If I'm cold I need some heat  
If I'm hungry then I eat  
I'm not responsible  
  
I woke up this morning and I couldn't find my shoes  
It's one long party and I haven't seen the sun for days  
I'd take you out tonight, but I'm just a little light  
So let's go out anyway, you'll be amazed  
  
I take my woman to the palace dancing  
I never coulda made it but the doorman is a friend of mine  
So I raise a glass to you, the foot is on the other shoe  
You can pay the bill and while you're at it pick up mine  
Oh, no no, I don't mind  
  
If it rains I stay inside  
If I'm scared I run and hide  
I'm not responsible, oh no

Falling in love falling out of debt  
Straight gay black or white  
Strutting in the dark hiding in the light  
Doing it wrong doing it right just doing it  
You got your life on the one hand  
Mine in the other  
I got the right we all got the right  
  
One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck  
One man's meat is someone's empty well  
One man's meat is some guy's aching butt  
One man's meat is another man's living hell  
  
Short fat thick or thin  
Take it in the gut take it on the chin  
Living in glory living in sin  
Hard day's work going down slow  
Riding the road where the green grass grows  
Watching in die what d'you know  
Watch it  
You got your life on the one hand  
Mine in the other  
I got the right  
  
One man's meat is the other man's lousy luck  
One man's meat is someone's empty well  
One man's meat is some guy's aching butt

Trying to see the sunlight  
My heart's crying out loud  
I try to see through the clouds  
On one more rainy day  
  
One more rainy day  
Once again my mind is gray  
This is what a rainy day can do  
One more rainy day  
One more rainy day  
  
Sun starts shining on through  
New day a day with you  
It's strange what sun can do  
On one more rainy day

Once again my mind is gray  
This is what a rainy day can do  
One more rainy day

Fighting with the truth  
Trying to hide a fool in a fantasy  
I'm dreaming, lay me down and take me now  
Our Lady of the skies  
  
Hiding in the sun like a loaded gun reality  
Aiming high at my dream  
But I can get along  
She makes me strong, anyway  
I'm dreaming and there is no other way  
Our Lady of the skies  
  
Flying in the sky with a bunch of high fidelity  
I can hear your song  
Offer me a ring just to show me your sincerity  
I'm dreaming, let me go

Thieving bastards stole my life and legged it off into the night.  
It's a dirty business it's a dirty game.  
Everybody different but they're all the same.  
They draw you in you hear a siren call.  
Build you up so they can see you fall.  
You've seen it all before.  
Been there since time began.  
You know what's coming next.  
Everything gets out of hand.  
They've got the lot and god knows what they think that the deserve even more.  
Psychopathic tendencies, they've got a lot of answer for.  
Scratch my back and I'll stab Yours, no wonder it's a universal sickness.  
Who are they, you well might ask, come with me and you can be my whitness.  
It's a dirty business it's a crying shame.  
You blink your eye and all the laws have changed.

With flowers and my love, both never to come back.

Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day.  
  
I look inside myself and see my heart is black,  
I see my red door and I want it painted black.  
  
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts,  
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.  
  
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue,  
I could not forsee this thing happening to you.  
  
If I look hard enough into the setting sun,  
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes.

Peaceful as a final time

A thousand warriors I have known  
And laughing as the spirits appear  
All your life  
Shadows of another day

We must remain  
Perfect strangers  
  
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow  
  
A strand of silver hanging through the sky  
Touching more than you see  
The voice of ages in your mind  
Is aching with the dead of the night  
Precious life (your tears are lost in  
Falling rain)  
  
And if you hear me talking on the wind  
You've got to understand  
We must remain  
Perfect strangers

Look at the floor and be oh, so cool  
Oh, so cool?  
  
How shall I know when to start singing my song?  
What shall I do if they all go wrong?  
What shall I do?

So let it pass baby now, the slow and riding cloud  
Which may take me from you  
  
Many things a man can lose  
His self, his rights, his views  
But never his heart or his love  
So take this hand of mine and climb baby, climb  
To the hill up above

While our children play in the field  
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life  
And trust in the strength of the shield  
  
So trust in you love, and Lucy of above  
And let light pass like a wheel  
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance  
Kiss the strength of the shield  
  
The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground  
And to his wish he will yield  
  
Fate will have it's word, of course  
(Think this line is wrong)  
And time will change its course  
And hold the strength of the shield
