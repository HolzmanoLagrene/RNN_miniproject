About the way  
I lived the life of a drifter  
Waiting for the day  
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs  
Then maybe you would say  
Come lay with me and love me  
And I would surely stay  
  
But I feel I'm growing older  
And the songs that I have sung  
Echo in the distance  
Like the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
Guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune.  
  
Many times I've been a traveler  
I looked for something new  
In days of old when nights were cold  
I wandered without you  
But those days I thought my eyes  
Had seen you standing near  
Though blindness is confusing  
It shows that you're not here.  
  
Now I feel I'm going older  
And the songs that I have sung  
Echo in the distance  
Like the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
Guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune  
  
Yes, I can hear the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
I guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune.  
  
I guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune.

Empty hearts and icy stares

Follow me everywhere  
A heart without an echo  
A man without a child  
Alone with all my sorrow

A strange kind of woman  
The kind that gets written down in history  
Her name was Nancy  
Her face was nothing fancy  
She left a trail of happiness and misery  
  
I loved her  
Everybody loved her  
She loved everyone and gave them good return  
I tried to take her  
I even tried to break her  
She said I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn  
  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
I spent my money as I took my turn  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
Ooh I got a strange kind of woman  
  
She looked like a raver  
But I could never please her  
On Wednesday mornings boy you can't go far  
I couldn't get her  
But things got better, she said  
Saturday nights from now on baby you're my star  
  
She finally said she loved me  
I wed her in a hurry  
No more callers and I glowed with pride  
I'm dreaming  
I feel like screaming  
I won my woman just before she died  
  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
I spent my money as I took my turn  
I want you I need you I gotta be near you  
Ooh I had a strange kind of woman

Get some decent clothes  
The only way to make it  
Dress the part'  
That gets right up my nose  
  
And I think to myself in this river of doubt  
This is something I can do without  
But strangeways is what I got  
  
The indians are coming Isaw it on tv  
They're 20,000 strong  
But they always get depleted by the cavalry  
Salvation is at hand  
It's guaranteed  
Just send a donation straight to God  
1-800 toll free  
  
And I think to myself in this academy of fear  
Where am I going what am I doing here  
But strangeways is all I got  
  
Have you seen the headlines  
Princess engaged  
3 million out of work  
But that's on the 2nd page  
The alien has landed  
Finger in his ear  
Can't hear a word I am saying  
But that ain't such a bad idea

Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust

So good, like we never parted  
Said to myself, I knew you'd set me free  
And here we are right back where we started  
  
Something's come over me and I don't know what to feel

Now I'm gonna see what I want it to be

In this breathing space

Cause the steps are elusive  
The membership is too costly  
And exclusive

The more I stand to lose  
So I'm gonna unpack my bags  
And take off my shoes

At the big oak door  
Can't you see that it's all full up

Diving in the dark  
Rolling with the punches  
Striking at the heart  
Touching all the senses  
Breaking those taboos  
Bursting at the seams  
Blowing all my fuses  
  
The turning of a page  
The burning of a book

When the time is right

All tattered and torn  
I stand here naked  
As the day I was born.  
  
Over and over I stand  
I'm holding the world in my hand  
I got to believe  
  
The sky is falling  
On this setting son  
Echoes of silence  
Ringing loud and long  
This isolation  
Is the king of pain  
A lost horizon  
In an ocean of flames  
  
Only the lonely will stand  
I'm holding the world in my hand  
I got to believe  
  
I've been here before,  
But not as I stand here today  
I wait for the dawn  
Ready to walk  
Into the light

Sometimes it ain't what it seems  
I'm all in a daze  
Can't find my way out of this maze  
I'm looking for clues  
And wanting a change in the rules  
I'm locked in a cage  
Acting out on the wrong stage  
  
Don't want your sympathy  
Don't need the third degree  
Just got to break away and scream  
I'm caught in a dream  
  
I'm stood at the edge and I'm looking down  
Caught in the danger zone  
I feel like a king that has lost his crown  
And now I stand here alone  
  
Don't want your sympathy  
Don't need the third degree  
Just got to break away and scream  
I'm caught in a dream!!!  
  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love  
  
I don't care if you pull down the sky  
Angry passion is a friend of mine  
Reach out for the sky above  
It's just a fractured love  
  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love

Why don't you set me free!

You're already on your knees

Never gonna die now  
Crawling from a wrecked jam, I'm laughing out loud  
Angel on my shoulder  
Living at the speed of sound  
Heavenly distraction  
I'm hanging on the edge and spinning out of control  
Choose your medication  
It's a generation overload  
  
I can see it falling from the sky  
Can you feel me  
I can hear you calling when you cry  
Can you see me  
Pain and suffering, your knees are tied  
Will you hear me  
Everchanging as your worlds collide  
  
Running going nowhere  
Take it to the limit then it's payback time  
Nothing but a heartache  
Waiting at the end of the line  
Take a look around, babe  
You're looking down the barrel of a loaded mind  
Generation landslide  
Crawling through the enemy lines  
  
I will be the one your justify  
Will you hear me  
I will kiss you with a last goodbye  
  
I thought I was the one who could survive  
Does anyone get outta here alive  
I gotta find the courage, gotta make a change  
And start all over again  
Taken for a ride against my will  
And taking it is always such a bitter pill  
Shaken for the sake of it, no more  
Gotta get away cause I don't know what I'm doing it for  
  
I can see it falling from the sky  
Can you feel me  
I can hear you calling when you cry  
Can you see me  
I will be there when you close your eyes  
Will you hear me  
Everchanging as your worlds collide

Charge it up, make it automatic

At school on the playground

Can't believe that I put up with all this pain  
I've been used and I was choking on the promise

The words that had me trapped inside your misery  
But now I know  
The reason why I couldn't breathe

Cause all I want is everything you're not  
So go ahead and slam the door  
Cause you can't shut me out  
And no I don't, I don't care what you say  
Cause all I really, all I really want  
Is everything you're not  
  
Everything you're not not not  
  
Your darkness was my weakness but it turns out  
That it only went so deep  
A meaningless diversion that is all that you  
Ever meant to me  
  
And I am done with your twisted symphony  
The words that had me sound like stolen poetry  
I tore the pages and I can finally breathe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want a gentleman who treats me like a queen  
I need respect, I need love  
Nothing in between  
  
I will not spell it out for you if you can't see  
Cause you're not worthy, you don't deserve me  
A now I'm gone  
  
Everything you're not, not, not  
Everything you're not, not, not

Never gonna see your face again  
Never wanna feel this way again

Unprepared.

That's keeping us going.  
It may not last forever,  
But oh, when it's flowing.  
  
There's something magical in the air.  
Some things so tragic we have to care.  
  
It's a strange obsession,  
That's's drawing us nearer.  
We don't understand it,  
It never gets clearer.  
  
There's something mystical in our genes.  
So simplistic it kicks and screams.  
  
Oh when we're teetering  
On the edge of the collapse,  
Nothing can keep us down.  
  
It's a dizzying feeling  
That's keeping us flying.  
Some glittering galas,  
Without even trying.  
  
There's something radical in our hands.  
Nothing logical to our plans.

Befriend the glorious end of the line
