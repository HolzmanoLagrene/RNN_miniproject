For the poor tortured souls  
Who fall at your feet  
With their love begging bowls  
All the clerks and the tailors  
The sharks and the sailors  
All good at their trades  
They'll always be failures  
Alms for the poor  
For the wretched disciples  
And the love that they swore  
With their hearts on the bible  
Beseeching the honor  
To sit at your table  
And feast on your holiness  
As long as they're able  
Love needs its martyrs  
Needs its sacrifices  
They live for your beauty  
And pay for their vices  
Love will be the death of  
My lonely soul brothers  
But their spirit shall live on in  
The hearts of all lovers  
Your holding court  
With your lips and your smile  
Your body's a halo  
Their minds are on trial  
Sure as Adam is Eve  
Sure as Jonah turned whaler  
They're crooked love thieves  
And you are their jailer  
Love needs its martyrs  
Needs its sacrifices  
They live for your beauty  
And pay for their vices  
Love will be the death of  
My lonely soul brothers  
But their spirit shall live on in  
The hearts of all others  
Love will be the death of  
My lonely soul brothers  
But their spirit shall live on in  
The hearts of all others

The sinner inside  
And keep him denied  
How sweet life would be  
If I could be free  
From the sinner in me

Not renowned for my patience  
I'm not renowned for my restraint  
But you're always around  
You can always be found  
To pick me up when I'm on the ground

I'm still recovering  
Still getting over all the suffering  
More known for my anger  
Than for any other thing  
But you've always tried  
To be by my side  
And catch my fall when I start to slide

Hanging in the sky  
Opening old wounds?  
  
Taking hold of the hem of your dress  
Cleanliness only comes in small doses  
Bodily whole, but my head's in a mess  
Fueling obsession that borders psychosis  
  
It's a sad disease  
Creeping through my mind  
Causing disabilities  
Of the strangest kind  
  
Getting lost in the folds of your skirt  
There's a price that I pay for my mission  
A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt  
How I suffer the sweetest condition

Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder  
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice  
Wandering around in silent wonder

On solid ground well that proved wrong

And let the games begin  
'Cause it's easy  
It's perfectly easy  
To spin that wheel 'round  
'Til you turn it all upside down  
It's easy

To let that wheel spin  
'Til the numbers come back right to you  
Now spin that wheel  
There's nothing to lose  
Spin that wheel  
It's waiting for you  
Now spin that wheel  
Let the wheel decide  
Spin that wheel

The fun that disappeared so soon

Diana Ross,A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes,/d/diana+ross/a+dream+is+a+wish+your+heart+makes_20821336.html,"A dream is a wish your heart makes  
When you're fast asleep  
In dreams you will lose your heartaches  
Whatever you wish for, you keep  
  
Have faith in your dreams and someday  
Your rainbow will come smiling through  
No matter how your heart is grieving  
If you keep on believing  
The dream that you wish will come true  
  
No matter how your heart is grieving  
If you keep on believing  
The dream that you wish will come true  
So dream

I'm just a girl who discovers  
Now and then lovers  
Who never ask me to stay

Now I'm walking by myself

Just call my name. I'll be there in a hurry.  
On that you can depend and never worry.  
(you see, my love is alive it's like a seed that only needs the thought of you
to grow.  
So if you feel the need for company, please, my darling, let it be me.  
I may not be able to express the love I feel for you,  
but a writer put it very nicely when he was away from the one he loved.  
he said down and wrote these words:)  
  
No wind, (no wind) no rain, (no rain)  
Nor winter's cold  
Can stop me, babe (oh, babe) baby (baby)  
If you're my goal  
  
No wind, no rain,  
Can stop me, babe  
If you want to go  
  
I know, I know you must follow the sun  
Wherever it leads  
But remember  
If you should fall short of your desires  
Remember life holds for you one guarantee  
You'll always have me  
  
And if you should miss my love  
One of these old days  
If you should ever miss the arms  
That used to hold you so close, or the lips  
That used to touch you so tenderly  
Just remember what I told you  
The day I set you free  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough  
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)  
Ain't no river wild enough  
To keep me from you  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough  
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)  
Ain't no river wild enough

Nothing can keep me  
To keep me from you  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough  
Ain't no valley low enough (one more time)  
Ain't no river wild enough (say it again)

Better treasure what we've got  
I'll never give another anymore than I gave to you

They beg me not to leave  
Could it be we might have passed  
On the same road to loneliness  
  
Let us put bad memories  
Of our past up on the shelf  
(And leave it there forever)  
And give ourselves a second chance  
To enjoy love's priceless wealth

How I'll hate going out in the storm!  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still goodbying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

Into your arms, I felt so unaware  
Of the loneliness that was waiting there

You turned and you walked, just walked away

Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

I enjoyed the picture show  
When you walked me to my door  
I knew I wanted more  
When I asked you in  
It was already getting late  
Though I knew better  
I didn't eaven hesitate  
I like the way you hold me  
And make me feel so good  
Though I say I wouldn't  
You kinda knew that I would  
It's been so long since I've  
Been with a man  
Better ask myself  
While I still can  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  
And how about you  
Do you really want me  
Or am I just here  
To please your masculinity  
You don't see me emough  
To let me know you care  
You know the worst thing for a woman  
Is a sometime love affair  
Seems like every time  
I satisfy your needs  
You don't call me back  
For two or three weeks  
What am I gonna do  
I just can't fight  
The temptation of loving you  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  
Sometimes it's hard  
To tel the difference  
I'm just not sure  
If it's worth it  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  
'cause you never show up 'til midnight  
Then you go home early  
Now you know that ain't right  
I've got a question I wanna ask you  
Do you really love me or am I just a fool  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it

I knew from the first time I saw you  
I wanted you for myself  
You feel the same though it's got to be wrong  
We each belong to somebody else  
Once it was vague desire  
Now it's a raging fire  
Those things that people are saying  
Can't keep our love on the shelf  
How long can we talk about it  
What good is life without it  
Love will make it right  
Love will make it right  
Love will choose the night  
Love will make it right  
Four friends are driving on Sunday  
Our smiles a useless disguise  
By now they know what's inside our hearts  
My sweet, it shows in your eyes  
Through all the foolish laughter  
They know just what we're after  
How long can we keep on living  
This life of unspoken lies  
Some will be touched with sadness  
But how can we stop the madness  
Love will make it right  
Love will make it right  
Love will choose the night  
Love will make it right  
Some will be touched with sadness  
But how can we stop the madness

There's leaking in the washroom there's a stinking personnel  
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze  
'Goodness me could this be Industrial Disease?  
  
The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post

The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas

There's panic on the switchboard tongues are in knots  
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots  
Some blame the management some the employees  
Everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease

Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees  
That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'

Philosophy is useless, theology is worse

They want to have a war to keep us on our knees  
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese  
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease  
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind  
They want to sap your energy, incarcerate your mind  
They give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three  
Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'  
Meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon  
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons'  
The other one's out on hunger strike he's dying by degrees

The wood and leather the club and shield

Oh it's a dangerous road  
And a hazardous load  
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat  
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

The moon is hanging upside down

And every victory has a taste that's bittersweet

In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud  
  
Hallelujah here she comes queen roller ball  
Enchante what can I say don't care at all  
You know she used to have to wait around  
She used to be the lonely one  
But now that she can skate around town  
She's the only one  
  
No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd  
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud  
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station  
And a rock and roll dream  
She's making movies on location  
She don't know what it means  
But the music make her want to be the story  
And the story was whatever was the song what it was  
Roller girl don't worry  
DJ play the movies all night long  
  
She tortures taxi drivers just for fun  
She like to read their lips  
Says toro toro taxi see ya tomorrow my son  
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip  
She got her own world in the city  
You can't intrude on her  
She got her own world in the city  
'Cause the city's been so rude to her  
  
No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd  
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud  
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station  
And a rock and roll dream  
She's making movies on location  
She don't know what it means  
But the music make her want to be the story  
And the story was whatever was the song what it was  
Roller girl don't worry  
DJ play the movies all night long  
  
Come slipping and sliding  
Life's roller ball  
Slipping and a sliding  
Skate away that's all  
Shala shalay hey hey skate away  
She's going singing shala shalay hey hey  
Skate away

Dire Straits,Tunnel Of Love,/d/dire+straits/tunnel+of+love_20040744.html,"Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose  
Sing about the six blade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo  
And I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam  
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am  
  
In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light  
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night  
I put my hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll  
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk  
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this  
It's just a cakewalk twisting baby step right up and say  
Hey mister give me two give me two 'cause any two can play  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig  
Money for muscle another girl I dig  
Another hustle just to make it big  
And rock away rock away  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids  
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids  
  
She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this  
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss  
And in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away  
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me
stay  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades  
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades  
In any shooting gallery where promises are made  
To rock away rock away from Cullercoats and Whitley bay out to rock away  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids  
Girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids

So why worry now

And you make sense of what I do  
And all the isn't hard is the same

Our love comes shinning red and gold  
And all the rest is by the way  
  
Why worry

And brushes her long blonde hair.  
And then she asked me  
Do I look alright?  
I said yes, you look wonderful tonight  
  
We go to a party  
And everyone turns to see  
This beautiful woman walking around with me  
And then she asked me  
Do you feel alright?  
I said yes, I don't feel good  
I feel wonderful because I see  
No love light in your eyes  
And the wonder of it all  
Is that you just don't realize  
How much I love you.  
  
It's time to go home now  
And I got a big headache  
So i give her the car keys  
She helps me to bed

I say my darling

Prehistoric garbage trucks  
Got the city to themselves  
Echoes and the roars dinosaurs  
They're all doing the monster mash  
And most of the taxis and the whores  
Are only taking calls for cash  
  
I don't know how it happened  
It all took place so quick  
But all I can do is hand it to you  
And your latest trick  
  
My door was standing open  
Security was laid back and lax  
But it was only my heart got broken  
You must have had a pass key made out of wax  
You played robbery with insolence  
And I played the blues in twelve bars on Lover's Lane  
And you never did have the intelligence to use  
The twelve keys hanging off my chain  
  
I don't know how it happened  
It all took place so quick  
But all I can do is hand it to you  
And your latest trick  
  
Now it's past last call far alcohol  
Past recall has been here and gone  
The landlord finally paid us all  
The satin jazzmen have put away their horns  
And we're standing outside of these wonderlands  
Looking so bereaved and so bereft  
Like a bowery bum when he finally understands  
The bottle's empty and there's nothing left  
  
I don't know how it happened  
It all took place so quick  
But all I can do is hand it to you

Tell me what your feeling lately  
You just can't keep it all  
Locked up so deep inside  
It's better just to let it go  
Let my chest be your pillow  
Keep you warm when you get cold  
And when you start to fall  
I wanna let you know  
That we all have our reasons  
They come and go like seasons  
Summer, fall, through winter, spring  
All the heart ache that they bring  
Let this rain wash the pain away  
I pray this love is here to stay  
Been there in your heart from the very start  
I swear to you I'm never leavin.  
  
You know me  
I aint no cloudy weather  
And when the sun don't shine ima make it better  
Always

Don't cry ima make it better  
Open your eyes don't cry  
Ima make it better  
Always  
Don't cry ima make it better  
Open your eyes sunshine  
Ima make it better  
Always  
  
I'll be your cover, be your shelter  
To protect you from the weather  
Tell me what you need  
Count on me to make it better  
Call on me so late at night  
Just to be your guiding light boo  
So when the rain comes fallin  
Ima be the one to catch you  
I'm gonna take my time with you  
The storm is coming come inside  
I've been there too.  
Nothin ever gonna hurt you  
As long as I'm beside you  
Hold my hand don't close your eyes I'm here  
We're gonna make it through  
  
Hey don't go  
I wanna let you know  
Hey don't go  
I'm gonna miss you so

And when the sun don't shine ima make it better

Divine,You Think You're A Man,/d/divine/you+think+youre+a+man_20355043.html,"Turn around, stand up like a man and look me in the eye  
Turn around, take one final look at what you've left behind  
Then walk away from the greatest lover you have ever known  
Yes walk away, you're telling me that you can make it on your own  
By yourself, all alone, without my help  
Mister you just made a big mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
You think you're a man but you're only a boy  
You think you're a man but you're only a toy  
You think you're a man but you just couldn't see  
You weren't man enough to safisfy me.  
Shut the door, take a look around and tell me what you find  
  
Shut the door, take a giant step for you and all mankind  
Then don't come back, I always gave you so much more than you deserve  
No, don't come back 'cause no one makes a fool of me  
You've got a nerve to walk away, mark the words I'm gonna say  
Mister you just made a big mistake.

Dolly Parton,A Christmas To Remember,/d/dolly+parton/a+christmas+to+remember_20041798.html,"You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no  
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow  
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go  
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes  
  
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way  
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet  
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood  
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave  
Christmas to remember, too good to believe  
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again  
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind  
  
And you've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
We loved and laughed and played and joked  
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks  
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes  
Then to the lodge for dinner  
But now it's time for us to go  
As our hearts melt like chimney snow  
There's just one thing I want to know  
Can we do this next winter  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember

Dolly Parton,A Few Old Memories,/d/dolly+parton/a+few+old+memories_20041601.html,"Just a few old memories  
Slipped in through my door  
Though I thought I had closed it  
So tightly before  
I can't understand it  
Why it should bother my mind  
For it all belongs to another place and time  
  
Just a few old keep-sakes  
Way back on the shelf  
No, they don't mean nothin'  
Well I'm surprised they're still left  
Just a few old love letters  
With the edges all brown  
And an old faded picture  
I keep turned upside-down  
  
Just a few old memories  
Going way back in time  
Well I can hardly remember  
I don't know why I'm cryin'  
I can't understand it  
Well I'm surprised myself  
First thing tomorrow morning  
I'll clean off that shelf  
  
Just a few old keep-sakes  
Way back on the shelf  
No, they don't mean nothin'  
Well I'm surprised that they're left  
Just a few old love letters  
With their edges all brown  
And an old faded picture  
I keep turned upside-down

Dolly Parton,A Lil' Ole Bitty Pissant Country Place,/d/dolly+parton/a+lil+ole+bitty+pissant+country+place_20237378.html,"It's just a little bitty pissant country place  
Ain't nothin' much to see  
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be  
It's just a piddly squatin' old time country place  
Ain't nothing to hide at all  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
But there's nothing dirty going on  
Nothing dirty going on  
We get simple farmers, local business men  
Congress folks from Austin, young boys looking for sin  
Now we used to get a lot of rough necks, when the oil boom was high  
But pay day would get a little rowdy, thank God the field ran dry  
  
Chorus:  
  
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see  
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be  
It's just a piddly squatin no time country place, nothing to hide at all  
Just lots of good will, and maybe one small thrill, but there's nothing dirty
going on  
  
I don't hire no married girl, they're not on the ball  
They got homes and husbands, they're not stable at all  
You know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day  
Now what's the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Keep your language clean girls, keep your bedrooms neat  
And don't hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street  
Mind you P's and Q's and manners, and you don't need no other tools  
Cause every girl that lives here knows my special no-no rules  
  
Yea every girl that lives here knows Miss Mona's no-no rules  
  
Ruby, Ray start em!  
  
Beds are not to be wallowed in  
That's the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do  
  
And it don't make money!  
Betrix!  
  
I won't tolerate no tying my telephone with other peoples business  
  
Eloise honey!  
  
And please don't show us no tattoos  
No hearts and flowers on your thigh  
  
It's downright tacky  
  
Brands for the cattle and that ain't what we're selling at Miss Mona's  
  
Do you catch my drift?  
I pay the food and the rent and the utilities  
You keep your mind on your work responsibilities  
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities  
And we can get along  
Dawn!  
  
Any bad habits you come in with, get rid off right now  
  
Tatty Joe!  
  
I can't stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow  
  
Lindy Lue!  
  
Any one taking sick leave for to make real sure their sick  
  
And every time you hear that bell...  
You better get here double quick  
  
And as for pimps  
Pimps are something you don't need  
To get your daily business done  
Are you listening good?  
Keep them leaches and blood suckers of the bathrobes  
And I know how to use a gun  
And nobody messes with my girls  
  
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place  
Don't grip and whine behind my back  
Just tell me face to face, I'm open-minded, say it all  
Then go upstairs and pack, the door's that way  
  
She pays the food and the rent and the utilities  
We keep our mind on our work responsibilities  
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities  
And we can get along  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see

Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill

Nothing dirty going on

You make me act like a fool  
You treat me mean and cold and cruel  
You make me do things that I hate to do  
Why do you make me act like a fool?  
Now that you know just how much I care  
You treat me mean and it ain't right nor fair  
I keep holdin' on though I don't know what to  
While you make me act like a fool  
You know just how to hurt me and you often do  
When we're out in publib I start fightin' with you  
You start trouble in private when nobody knows  
Oh, then you go away smellin' just like a rose  
Though you make me act like a fool  
You treat me mean cold and cruel  
You make me do things that I hate to do  
Oh, why must you make me act like a fool?  
You know just how to hurt me as you often do  
You start flirtin' in public with somebody new  
You start trouble in private when nobody knows  
Oh then you go away smellin' just like a rose  
Though you make me act like a fool  
You treat mean and cold and cruel  
You make me do things that I hate to do  
Oh but why do you make, oh why do I let you  
Make me look like a fool?

Be careful what you drink, don't harm yourself  
And pollution in the air might make you sick  
Makes you afraid to live, afraid that you might die too quick  
Do the men that quote this danger really know  
Life is gift to be enjoyed and not to worry so  
The biggest danger sign that we should know  
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go  
  
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'  
And afraid to love the one we love, afraid they might be lyin'  
We can't enjoy life when they say each thing might bring an early grave  
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'  
  
Do the men that quote this danger really know?

And if every dream you ever had broke your heart  
If every time you made a plan the world came to an end  
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again  
If broken dreams are all it seems you've ever known  
And hurt's the only thing you can depend upon  
And if you should find misery to be your only friend  
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again  
If every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun  
Pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone  
If everything you try should fail before you can begin  
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again  
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again

Dolly Parton,After The Goldrush,/d/dolly+parton/after+the+goldrush_20041766.html,"Well I dreamed I saw the knight in armor coming  
Saying something about a king  
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming  
And the archer split the tree  
  
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun  
That was floating on the breeze  
Look at mother nature on the run  
In the twenty-first century  
Look at mother nature on the run  
In the twenty-first century  
  
I was lying in a burned out basement  
With the full moon in my eyes  
I was hoping for replacement  
When the sun burst through the sky  
  
There was a band playing in my head  
And I felt like I could cry  
I was thinking about what a friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
Thinking about what a friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
  
Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flyin'  
In the yellow haze of the sun  
There was laughing, crying and colors flying  
All around the chosen one  
  
All in a dream, all in a dream, the loading had begun  
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun  
They were flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home

Dolly Parton,Alabama Sundown,/d/dolly+parton/alabama+sundown_20231303.html,"The cold December wind seems bent on rockin' New York City  
The town that's got me down to my last dime  
And everywhere I go, the people seem in such a hurry  
To keep this Mobile girl from feelin' fine  
  
[Chorus]  
Lord, what I'd give to see an Alabama sundown  
The sun just seemed to drop in Mobile Bay  
New York town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down  
But that never was the Mobile way, no, no  
That never was the Mobile way  
  
A flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar  
In anybody's town, that price is cheap  
It's a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards  
Cause I need ninety cents to go to sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I felt so big the day I left that Mobile couldn't hold me  
I thought there had to be a better way  
But if I could find that man that first called Lady Luck a lady  
That gentleman would surely learn to pray
