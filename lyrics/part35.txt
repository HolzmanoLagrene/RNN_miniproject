Dolly Parton,Always The First Time,/d/dolly+parton/always+the+first+time_20694739.html,"Now I've never stepped through the doors of a barroom or tasted the flavor of
wine  
And I've never danced to the songs on a jukebox or held someone that wasn't
mine  
But there's always the first time and if you don't change  
Then I guess the first time can't be arranged can't be arranged

Now I've never dressed for the eyes of the stranger to sow seeds of lust in
his mind  
And I've never walked down backroad of temptation to leave dirty footprints
behind  
But there's always the first time...

Dolly Parton,Amazing Grace,/d/dolly+parton/amazing+grace_20268831.html,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
Was blind but now I see  
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Through many dangers, toils and snares  
I have already come  
Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home  
  
When we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Than when we first begun  
  
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Amazing grace, oh amazing grace  
That saved a wretch like me  
Oh amazing grace, amazing grace

Dolly Parton,Appalachian Memories,/d/dolly+parton/appalachian+memories_20041615.html,"(Dolly Parton)  
You oughta go north somebody told us  
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust  
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands  
Now I don't recall you said it  
But we'd lived so long on credit  
And so we headed out to find our promised land  
Just poor Appalachian farm folk  
With nothing more than high hopes  
We hitched our station wagon to a star  
But our dreams all fell in on us  
'Cause there was no land of promise  
And it's a stuggle keepin' sight of who you are  
Oh and these northern nights are dreary  
And my southern heart is weary  
I wonder how the old folks are back home  
But I'll keep leanin' on sweet Jesus  
I know He'll love and guide and lead us  
Appalachian memories keep me strong  
Ya know I've been thinkin' a whole lot lately  
About what's been and what awaits me  
It takes all I've got to give what life demands  
You go insane if you give in to it  
Life's a mill and I've been through it  
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands  
Oh and these northern nights are dreary  
And my southern eyes are teary  
Don't I wonder how the old folks are back home  
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus  
I know he'll love and guide and lead us  
Appalachian memories keep me strong  
I'll keep lookin' to the Father  
Keep our heads above the water  
Appalachian memories keep me strong

He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack  
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack  
Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew  
AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song for me and I'll sing  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song, let your banjo ring  
Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday  
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made  
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing  
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song for me and I'll sing  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song, let your banjo ring  
That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown  
All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone  
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back  
And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack  
Play a song for me and I'll sing  
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack

I go wanderin' once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us  
And how my momma put the rags to use  
There were rags of many colors  
Every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat  
And it was way down in the fall  
Momma sewed the rags together  
Sewin' every piece with love  
She made my coat of many colors  
That I was so proud of  
As she sewed, she told a story  
From the bible, she had read  
About a coat of many colors  
Joseph wore and then she said  
I hope this coat will bring you  
Good luck and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it  
And momma blessed it with a kiss  
  
My coat of many colors  
That my momma made for me  
Made only from rags  
But I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money  
I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
  
So with patches on my britches  
And holes in both my shoes  
In my coat of many colors  
I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing  
And making fun of me  
And my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
  
And oh I couldn't understand it  
For I felt I was rich  
And I told them of the love  
My momma sewed in every stitch  
And I told 'em all the story  
Momma told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colors  
Was worth more than all their clothes  
  
But they didn't understand it  
And I tried to make them see  
That one is only poor  
Only if they choose to be  
Now I know we had no money  
But I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
My momma made for me  
Made just for me

Come back and mend this broken heart in me  
Without your love I know I'll never be complete  
Baby come back, won't you come back to me  
Oh please come back to me  
Baby come back, baby come back to me  
Baby come back, come back and say I'm all you need  
Come back, won't you come back to me  
Come back to me  
Come back and say you're still in love with me  
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need

Hello, I don't know me from Adam, you don't know me from Eve  
I just came here tonight 'cause I was lonely  
You're no Elvis Presley, I'm no Marilyn Monroe  
But I do think you're sexy, just thought I'd tell you so  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Your name and your number on a small photograph  
I'd like to know you and what you're all about  
Hey could I have your autograph  
I've had my eyes on you and you're worth lookin' at  
Could I ask you out or should a lady do that  
You may not be famous but you look like a star  
You should be in movies as cute as you are  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Your name and your number on a small photograph  
Could I interest you in a romance perhaps  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Got my heart in my hands and my head in the clouds  
And you're everything every girl dreams about  
And being with you would be heaven no doubt  
What I wouldn't do for your autograph  
Oh could I have your autograph  
Oh could I have your autograph  
Hey could I have your autograph  
I like your body could I help you work it out  
Maybe moving to the music playing on the phonograph  
Hey could I have your autograph  
Oh could I have your autograph  
You know you're just the kind to makes a woman real proud  
Would you take a chance on a girl from the South  
Could I have your autograph

Dolly Parton,Country Is As Country Does,/d/dolly+parton/country+is+as+country+does_20916457.html,"I can live in a mansion or a double-wide  
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried  
Wherever I am, then that's where I belong  
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am  
And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham  
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I am and it's the way I was  
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure  
Country born and country bred  
Countrified and country-fed  
A country heart and a country head  
'Cause I'm country to the core  
  
Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac  
I can fly first class or slum in the back  
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive  
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk  
Drink champagne or chocolate milk  
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I am and it's the way I was  
And the way I'll be until they lay me low  
Country born and country bred  
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed  
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead  
'Cause I'm country head to toe  
  
And what you see is what you get  
Nothing's ever changed me yet  
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet  
'Cause I'm country through and through  
  
Oh, that's country!  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I am and it's the way I was  
It's the way I'll be until my dying day  
I'm country born and country bred  
Countrified and country-fed  
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways  
Nothing done and nothing said  
Nothing's gonna change my country ways  
  
I don't think so  
Wouldn't change if I could  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I is and it's the way I was

That's where you've got to go

I left my hometown a hummin'  
With my ol' guitar a strummin'  
Songs that I had wrote  
I was on my way to Nashville  
I just couldn't hardly wait  
'Till I could sing my songs  
To the folks on Music Row  
I got into Nashville early  
Sleepy, hungry, tired and dirty  
And on the steps of RCA  
I ate a stale, sweet roll  
In the fountain at the hall of fame  
I washed my face and read the names  
In the walkway of the stars  
Down on Music Row  
Down on Music Row  
Down on music Row  
If you want to be a star  
That's where you've got to go  
I waited there 'till eight o'clock  
When office doors became unlocked  
Then I started walkin'  
Down the streets of Music Row  
Just a walkin' up and down the street  
Tryin' to find out who to see  
To help me get on record  
And to hear the songs I'd wrote  
But I found it goin' rough  
Everyone was all tied up  
Either in a conference  
Or in the studio  
They said that I could leave a tape  
But they'd suggest I didn't wait  
'Cause everyone was awful busy  
Down on Music Row  
But I could feel that change a comin'  
And I just kept right on a hummin'  
With my ol' guitar still strummin'  
All them songs that I'd wrote  
And then Chet and Bob at RCA  
Well, they listened to my songs that day  
And they both told me that I was on my way  
Down on Music Row

And in my song I hope to sing

To live among us mountain folks  
In eastern Tennessee  
And he delivered more than half

A neighbor and a doctor  
Though he seldom got a dime  
For all he'd done  
And I remember lots of times  
We sent for Dr. Thomas  
But I don't recall a time  
He didn't come  
They say a man is judged  
By the deeds he does while livin'  
A judgement when he stands  
Before the Lord  
And I know heaven holds a place  
For men like Dr. Thomas  
And I know that he'll receive  
His just reward

May his name forever stand

I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly  
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild  
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me  
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze  
  
Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun  
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums  
Drops of morning dew still lingers on the iris leaves

Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray  
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day

Through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left behind

Never wanted as a kid until the year I turned 13  
Then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forth  
Men just took me as they pleased  
And others had a Cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way  
  
On a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress  
With the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck  
And the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time  
Or should I fear what lay before me less than what I'd left behind  
A 15 year old girl don't have no trouble hitching rides  
But sometimes when you're riding free  
You'll pay the highest price  
On back roads and in back seats  
And in a cheap highway motel  
But what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way  
  
16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet light  
On the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night  
When I walked into the parlour here  
Other pieces seemed to fit  
I was good at pleasing strangers  
So I made the most of it  
  
Either way it's all a gamble  
So view the stakes and know the odds  
And lay your cards upon the table  
Do all the dealing from the top  
  
Though the deck is stacked against you  
Win or lose, you have to play  
The hand a life has dealt you  
And It's a gamble either way

Without a love to call my own my life was incomplete  
It seems I couldn't help but think that love was not for me  
But my life took on a different twist when I met me a man that I couldn't
resist  
I didn't know what all I'd missed, and I'm a gettin' happy  
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy  
Yeah, I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone  
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone  
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song  
And he helps me sing along - I'm a gettin' happy  
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy  
Oh, people used to talk of love and I couldn't understand  
About the fire and the desire in lovin' a good man  
Oh, but now I know just what they meant since I met me a man that was Heaven
sent  
Wonder where the sadness went, cause I'm a gettin' happy  
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy  
I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone  
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone

Got someone to sing along and I'm a gettin' happy

Well the note says ""mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high  
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin'
wild  
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way""  
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta  
  
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon  
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room  
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to
say  
She said ""i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta  
  
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a
date  
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away  
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town  
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled
completely down  
  
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar
again  
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip
of gin

Makes me cry and makes me laugh  
My reflections on the past  
And the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life  
Ragged clothes and hand-me-downs  
Just enough to go around  
But the sweetest things in life are always free  
Like the songs the birds would sing  
And the sweet new grass of spring  
And the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree

Of a Smokey Mountain boy  
I remember my first kiss and my first love  
And the songs I'd song and write  
And the dreams I'd clutch so tight  
And the loved ones that gave me that extra shove  
And in that little house 'a prayer  
Where I spent many hour  
Prassin' God and liftin' up His name  
And asking Him to lead and to keep watch over me  
As I headed up that rocky road to fame  
And now this, Smokey Mountain girl has been all around the world  
But it makes no difference just how far I roam  
I still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart  
My faith in God and memories of home

I can finish any sentence you start  
I know you, I know you by heart  
I know you by heart  
And you're so much a part of me

It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do  
I can finish any sentence you start  
I know you, I know you by

And hated to let you go  
How many, how many I wonder  
But I really don't want to know  
  
And how many lips have kissed you  
And set your soul aglow  
How many, how many I wonder  
But I really don't want to know  
  
So always make me wonder  
And always make me guess  
Even if I ask you  
Darlin', don't confess  
  
No you just let that remain your secret  
'Cause darlin' I do love you so  
How many, how many I wonder  
But I really don't want to know  
  
How many, how many I wonder  
But I really don't want to know

Don Henley,A!! She Wants To Do Is Dance,/d/don+henley/a+she+wants+to+do+is+dance_20636725.html,"They're picking up the prisoners  
And putting them in a pen  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
Rebels been rebels since I don't know when  
And all she wants to do is dance  
Molotov cocktail, the local drink  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
They mix them up right in the kitchen sink  
And all she wants to do is dance  
Crazy people walking around with blood in their eyes  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
Wild-eyed pistol wavers who ain't afraid to die  
And all she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
She can't feel the heat comming off the street  
She wants to party  
She wants to get down  
All she wants to do  
All she wants to is dance  
  
Well the goverment, bugged the men's room  
In the local disco lounge  
All she wants to do is dance, dance  
To keep the boys from selling  
All the weapons they can scrounge  
All she wants to do is dance  
But that don't keep the boys  
From making a buck or two  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
They still can sell the army  
All the drugs that they can do  
And all she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
  
Well, we barely made the airport  
For the last plane out  
As we taxied down the runway  
I could hear the people shout, they said:  
""Don't come back here, Yankee.""  
But if I ever do, I'll bring more money  
Cause all she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
  
Nevermind the heat  
Coming off the street  
She wants to party  
She wants to get down  
All she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
All she wants to do is dance  
And make romance

Slicker than a mambo band

And stood upright on the land  
There are some things that we just don't  
Understand:  
Relieve all pain and suffering  
And lift us out of the dark  
Turn us all into methuselah-  
But where are we gonna park?  
(building, building)  
The secrets of eternity-  
We've found the lock and turned the key  
We're shakin' up those building blocks  
Going deeper into that box- (pandora  
Wouldn't like it)  
And now the day is come  
Soon he will be released

The lanes and the meadows  
The places where you used to play

By the well-connected  
Your little protest  
Summarily rejected  
  
It was an inside job  
Like it always is  
Chalk it up to business as usual  
  
While we are dreaming  
This little island disappears  
While you are looking the other way  
They'll take your right to own your own ideas

Your trusted servants  
Have left you unprotected

What those men up in the towers  
Are doing to me and you  
And they'll keep doin' it and doin' it  
And doin' it and doin' it  
And doin' it and doin' it  
And doin' it and doin' it  
Until we all wake up  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up  
  
I know what I've done wrong  
I am acquainted with the night  
I know how hard it is  
To always walk out in the light

To learn about forgiving  
It's an inside job  
To hang on to the joy of living

They know your mother's maiden name  
And what you had for breakfast  
And what you've hidden in the mattress  
  
Insect politics  
Indifferent universe  
Bang your head against the wall  
But apathy is worse

Don Henley,Little Tin God,/d/don+henley/little+tin+god_20042060.html,"A new age is dawning  
On fewer than expected  
Business as Usual  
That's how the headline read  
Some shaky modern saviors  
Have now been resurrected  
In all this excitement  
You may have been misled  
  
People want a miracle  
They say Oh Lord, can't you see us?  
We're tryin' to make a livin' down here  
And keep the children fed  
But, from little dark motel rooms  
To Six Flags over Jesus  
How are the mighty fallen  
So the Bible said  
  
You don't have to pray to a little tin god  
Step out of the way for a little tin god  
You might fear the reaper, fear the rod  
But you never have to get down on your knees  
You don't have to holler, please, please  
No, you never have to get down on your knees  
For a little tin god  
  
The cowboy's name was Jingo  
And he heard that there was trouble  
So in a blaze of glory  
He rode out of the west  
No one was ever certain  
What it was that he was sayin'  
But they loved it when he told them  
They were better than the rest  
  
But you don't have to pray to a little tin god  
Step out of the way for a little tin god  
You might hate the system, hate the job  
But you never have to get down on your knees  
You don't have to holler, please, please  
No, you never have to get down on your knees  
For a little tin god  
  
Throw down a rope from heaven  
And lead the flock to water  
The man in the middle would have you think  
That you have no other choice  
But to wander in the wilderness  
Of all the upturned faces  
If you stop and listen long enough  
You will hear your own small voice  
  
But you don't have to pray to a little tin god  
Step out of the way for a little tin god  
You might fear the reaper, fear the rod  
But you never have to get down on your knees  
You don't have to holler, please, please  
No, you never have to get down on your knees  
Never have to holler, please, please  
You never have to get down on your knees  
You never have to holler, please, please  
You never have to get down on your knees

Don Henley,Through Your Hands,/d/don+henley/through+your+hands_20042096.html,"You were dreamin'  
On a park bench  
'Bout a broad highway somewhere  
When the music from the carillon  
Seemed to hurl your heart out there  
Past the scientific darkness  
Past the fireflies that float  
To an angel bending down  
To wrap you in his warmest coat  
  
And you ask  
What am I not doing  
He says  
Your voice cannot command  
In time you will move mountains  
And it will come through your hands  
  
Still you argue for an option  
Still you angle for your case  
Like you wouldn't know a burning bush  
If it blew up in your face  
Yeah, we scheme about the future  
And we dream about the past  
When just a simple reaching out  
Might build a bridge that lasts  
  
And you ask  
What am I not doing  
He says  
Your voice cannot command  
In time you will move mountains  
And it will come through your hands  
Through your hands  
  
So whatever your hands find to do  
You must do with all your heart  
There are thoughts enough  
To blow men's minds  
And tear great worlds apart  
There's a healing touch to find you  
On that broad highway somewhere  
To lift you high  
As music flyin'  
Through the angel's hair  
  
Don't ask what you are not doing  
Because your voice cannot command  
In time we will move mountains  
And it will come through your hands

Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky  
A dream come true, I'll live there 'til I die  
I'm asking you, to say my last goodbye  
The love we knew, ain't worth another try  
  
Save me from all the trouble and the pain  
I know I'm weak but I can't face that girl again  
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain  
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain  
  
Oh, but how can words express the feel of sunlight  
In the morning in the hills away from city strife  
I need a country woman for my wife  
I'm city born but I love the country life  
  
For I can not be part of her ""Cocktail-Generation Partner's Waltz,""  
Devoid of all romance  
The music plays and everyone must dance  
I'm bowing out, I need a second chance  
  
Save me from all the trouble and the pain

Tell her the reasons why I can't remain

My heart begins sinkin', I don't hear a sound  
And the world is in blackness, no light shines on me  
I suffer no blindness, no one can I see  
Then a flash from the heavens like a loud jagged wire  
And the silence is broken, and the night is on fire.  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like chain lightning, this love that I feel.  
Who know's where it strikes or when it will hit,  
How long it will last, or when it will quit.  
  
In the forest I'm burning, struck down by the blast  
The fever is churning, and the heat rises fast.  
And those standing nearest can show their concern  
But I swear if they touch me that they too will burn.  
They fear for their lives for death will soon dwell  
In the warmth of your love is the fire of hell.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And soon the sparks scatter and wind whips the flame  
And love will soon shatter what it cannot tame  
And the cycle continues, from life into dust  
For I am now in you with the fire of lust.  
And I hear the explosion, of thunder and rain,  
The water is falling, the ashes remain.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The Indian's tell us that the Phoenix can rise  
From the smoldering ashes that once were my eyes  
And watch beautiful colours from black and from grey  
Be formed into wings and take me away  
Where evil is darkness and goodness is light  
And love is the lightning that cuts through the night  
And strikes only once in a dark place in time  
And forms a gold stairway that all of us climb.

A big stuffed tiger is what I bought her  
And I'm going home 'cause it's late  
  
Roller coasters make me dizzy  
And cotton candy makes me sick  
I wish I had some Bromo fizzy  
Now that would do the trick  
  
Everyone knows that the clowns aren't happy  
And everyone knows that the people don't care  
I wish I could laugh at the way that they're acting  
But I'm so sick, I just don't dare to  
  
High wire dancers kick and balance  
White silk horses step in time  
The tattooed man displays his talents  
I'm not the talented kind  
  
I always go to the circus on Sunday  
And there I can laugh at the people I see  
But when I leave home in the morning on Monday  
Everybody laughs at me  
  
I make other people nervous  
I guess that's why they laugh at me  
But to me my life is a three-ring circus  
And I can see it for free  
  
Have you seen my wife Elvira?  
She can tame a lion, you know  
Well, I once had a bushy mane  
But that was so damn long ago  
  
Tight-collared clowns in plastic buildings  
Have happy families as their fate  
Happy jobs and happy clubs  
And happy people they hate  
  
Everyone's juggling and everyone's acting  
With smiles of grease paint three feet wide  
Everyone's caught on a carousel pony  
And one time around is a lifetime ride

Don McLean,Crying,/d/don+mclean/crying_10087404.html,"I was all right for a while, I could smile for a while  
But when I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight  
When you stopped to say ""Hello""  
And though you wished me well, you couldn't tell  
  
That I'd been crying over you, crying over you  
Then you said ""so long"" left me standing all alone  
Alone and crying, crying, crying crying  
It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand  
Can start me crying  
  
I thought that I was over you but it's tru-ue, so true  
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do  
For you don't love me and I'll always be  
  
Crying over you, crying over you  
Yes, now you're gone and from this moment on  
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying  
Yeah crying, crying, over you

Don McLean,Crying In The Chapel,/d/don+mclean/crying+in+the+chapel_20823542.html,"You saw me crying in the chapel.  
The tears I shed were tears of joy  
I know the meaning of contentment  
Now I am happy with the Lord  
  
Just a plain and simple chapel  
Where humble people go to pray  
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger  
As I live from day to day  
  
I've searched and I've searched  
But I couldn't find  
No way on earth  
To gain peace of mind  
  
Now I'm happy in the chapel  
Where people are of one accord  
We gather in the chapel  
Just to sing and praise the Lord  
  
Ev'ry sinner looks for something  
That will put his heart at ease  
There is only one true answer  
He must get down on his knees  
  
Meet your neighbor in the chapel  
Join with him in tears of joy  
You'll know the meaning of contentment  
Then you'll be happy with the Lord  
  
You'll search and you'll search  
But you'll never find  
No way on earth  
To gain peace of mind  
  
Take your troubles to the chapel  
Get down on your knees and pray  
Your burdens will be lighter  
And you'll surely find the way

Don McLean,Did You Know,/d/don+mclean/did+you+know_20181069.html,"Did you know that love can grow any place where people go,  
And I can tell by what I see that you have found a place with me.  
The sun is high the day is new and  
I have found a place with you.  
  
Every place and every face casts a spell and leaves a trace,  
With you in mind and with you near, the myth is gone, the past is clear  
And here with scars of now and then so you and I begin again.  
  
Did you know I've been searchin'? Did you know I've been blind?  
Did you know I've been touchin' anything I could find?  
  
Did you know that here below, moving where my feelings flow,  
You live with me in time that's new, suspended in a love that's true  
And far beyond the fatal noise and bathed in all life's simple joys.  
  
Did you know that love can grow any place where people go,  
And I can tell by what I see that you have found a place with me.

Don McLean,Falling Through Time,/d/don+mclean/falling+through+time_20195371.html,"I can't answer the questions you ask me,  
I don't know what to say.  
The answers are somewhere lost in the stars  
when the night has turned to day.  
But I know if the silence of night could be here,  
It would drift through my soul and calm all my fear  
And I could reach out and draw you so near to me  
  
Touch me and warm me and I will lie still.  
And all that you ask me to give you I will  
One living moment we'll have for our own.  
A brief flash of time that we spent all alone.  
But you ask me for nothing and give what you can  
And we're wrapped in a pillow of sleep once again  
And my memory drifts through the universe when we are one  
  
Closely we're falling through time  
And the earth will turn in the silence of space,  
always in motion yet always in place  
And all things will change yet remain what they are.  
And far will be near and near will be far  
And the ages will darken and blend into time  
And all that is poetry will no longer rhyme  
But our moment together is forever sublime  
  
For the time has arrived when we must understand  
That we're lost in a void on this sad speck of sand  
And nobody knows where we are, no one cares  
And the tears that we shed in the dark no one cares  
And the madmen who plunder this world for their fame  
Have forgotten that no one remembers their name  
But time and the universe are always the same  
  
Closely we're falling through time

Don McLean,General Store,/d/don+mclean/general+store_20207181.html,"Mornin', Mrs. Campbell  
Lovely day today  
I heard about the fire  
I wonder what the papers say  
  
Let's see now:  
Give me fifty shotgun shells  
And a hundred feet of rope  
Just add that to my bill  
  
Says here there ain't no hope  
They all were burned alive  
And four packs of cigarettes  
No, I think I'll make it five  
  
I heard about the wedding  
I'm so happy for the bride  
Why that fire house looked mighty nice  
And the whole town swelled with pride  
  
We've watched her grow to womanhood  
She's found an upright man  
She'll learn this life ain't easy  
You do the best you can  
  
No, no, my family ain't so good  
My wife just had a spell  
And I can't afford the medicine  
She needs to make her well  
  
I've been laid off at that factory  
For sixteen months or more  
I came home last Wednesday evenin'  
I found her lyin' on the floor  
  
Bye now, Mrs. Campbell  
Say howdy to your son  
You can tell him we'll go huntin'  
When he gets a bigger gun  
  
It was too bad about that fire  
But don't you get me wrong  
We've gotta teach these people  
How to stay where they belong

Don McLean,Genesis (In The Beginning),/d/don+mclean/genesis+in+the+beginning_20206465.html,"In the beginning there was nothingness and God but waved his hand  
And from the endless void there sprang the beauty of the land  
And high above the canyon walls the diamond stars were new  
And breezes blew from nothingness and herbs and grasses grew  
And silent creatures roamed the Earth and multiplied their [Do7]kind  
And man was but a molecule that God had left behind.  
  
[Chorus:]  
We have grown we have grown, we have captured the throne  
Of the kingdom God made for our winning.  
We have grown we have grown, but our children alone  
Have so little time left for beginning.  
  
And mountains sprang and chaos rang the overture of life  
And rivers coursed the twisted blade of natures sharpest knife  
And cut beneath the rolling dales a gateway to the sea  
While tidal waves and mighty gales were heard in symphony  
And sunshine fell upon the waves and warmed the virgin land  
And from the mud a drop of blood was left upon the sand.  
  
(Chorus)  
And eagles flew from craggy peaks above the garden wall.  
The drop of blood became a man, the tree of life grew tall.  
And perfect in his loneliness, a rib pulled from his chest  
Formed a sweet companion of pulchritude and breast.  
And from the tree of knowledge God said they could not eat.  
And perfect was their paradise unto the serpent at their feet.  
  
(Chorus)  
Tree of knowledge, tree of death, upon the ground they trod.  
The serpent said your eye's will see and ye will be a god.  
Defy the word and eat the fruit and ye will never die  
And you will chart your destiny and rule the Earth and sky.  
And man was banished east of Eden. See what we have lost.  
For though the father sets the price, the children pay the cost.  
  
(Chorus)

Don McLean,Infinity,/d/don+mclean/infinity_20273793.html,"Standin' on a trap door, there's a hole in the ground.  
Underneath the door there's a hole and it goes to infinity.  
Standin' on a dark street, there's a light in the sky.  
Followin' the light through the night as it goes to infinity.  
How can I avoid infinity? How have I annoyed infinity?  
I'm movin' slow in infinity. I even glow in infinity.  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's hard being' small, (hard bein' small)  
Shrinkin' into space, (shrinkin' into space)  
The world is just a ball, (world is just a ball)  
It was my favorite place (it was my favorites place)  
  
Lookin' for the blue skies, watchin' for the sunrise.  
One thing you can bet, you won't see it set in infinity.  
Gonna take a light beam, on the wings of the Jet Stream.  
Gonna take my place in the infinite space of infinity.  
How can I be friends with infinity? Can I make ammends with infinity?  
How can I complain to infinity? What'll I explain to infinity?  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Give me just a time shield before the world has it's fate sealed.  
Protect me for a while before they turn my dial to infinity.  
I hope I can contribute, oh, but I don't want a tribute.  
Hypocrites will come and say somethin' really dumb in infinity.  
I can't hear you sing in infinity. I can't change a thing in infinity.  
The absence of light in infinity gives me a fright in infinity.  
  
(Chorus)

Just the sky, with clouds a blowin' by.  
The sun and the moon and the sky, and you and I.  
  
It's just the rain that's rollin' down my cheek.  
It's just the wind that makes me hear you speak.  
It's just the song that anyone can sing.  
The rain and the wind and the song and the love you bring.  
  
It's just the world that gonna break your heart.  
It's just the past that's tearin' us apart.  
It's just the time we have so little of.  
The world and the past and the time that we fell in love.  
  
It's just the sun that's shinin' in your eyes  
It's just the moon that is the sun's disguise  
It's just the sky, with clouds a blowin' by

And some day my fame will make it clear  
That I had to be a Superman  
  
Verse 1  
He came from another place deep in his mind  
As far as the planets in space.  
As galaxy's mysteries start to unwind  
Some changes are bound to take place.  
  
Though gravity constantly weighs on my travels  
My mission is close to adrift  
Though I can be strong when my power unravels  
I still come to you for a lift.

Verse 2  
I know I can fly when my plane hits the sky  
I believe I've got nothing to lose.  
But when I'm alone with the bed and the phone  
I get the terminal metropolis blues  
  
I flew to the coast where Superman's Ghost  
Lay shot on the bedroom floor  
He said ""Watch out for TV it crucified me,  
But it can't crucify me no more.""  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Verse 3  
""I'm red white and blue, I've got justice to do  
I'm the man of your fantasy dreams  
But I'm an alien man from an alien land  
Who's alive on your orthicon screens.  
I once ruled the world and when flags were unfurled  
  
I performed for you live not on tape.  
But the public is cruel when played for a fool  
As you see by the blood on my cape.""

Verse 4  
  
""Well I never was real or stronger than steel.  
I'm a figment of Freudian need.  
And the video screen is a psychotic scene  
And it's all done with mirrors and green  
  
My agent just called, the talks have been stalled  
I soon will be pulled from the air.  
But the image persists in the video mists  
That a Superman still will be there!""

Don't get a bad reputation  
Don't need a bad reputation  
I'm so thankful momma I am waiting  
To find someone who  
Was looking in the same direction  
That you pointed to  
I'll never turn and walk away  
If my heart gives me the sign  
When the one, comes along  
He'll understand  
That the wait was worth the while  
Your reputation follows you wherever you go  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Don't need a bad reputation  
(Momma said, she said)  
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me  
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me  
Your reputation follows you wherever you go  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Don't need a bad reputation

Donna Summer,Be Myself Again,/d/donna+summer/be+myself+again_20744788.html,"Let me introduce myself  
I'm a woman that you've never seen  
You might know me from somewhere else  
As someone that I've never been.  
  
I gave everything to play the game  
My soul fell apart at the seams  
I fell down like a house of cards  
When somebody pulled the queen.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause you could spend your life  
Lookin' for your own reflection  
Time could blur the lines  
Between what's real and what's projected  
Had I known what I lost?  
What I gained, what it'd cost  
I'd still give what remains  
To be myself again.  
  
You must believe me when I say  
Don't live someone else's design  
Turn it around like a photograph  
The writings been there all the time.  
  
Now you can have all these hopes and dreams  
The ones I can't use anymore  
I don't know what it is you lost  
But I hope you got what you came for.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I want to leave right now  
Sometimes I want to cry out loud  
I want to let it all hang out  
But I don't want to let you down.  
  
Sometimes I want to just lay here  
Sometimes I want to disappear  
I want to show you all my fear  
But I don't want to let you down.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To be myself again...

Donna Summer,Black Lady,/d/donna+summer/black+lady_20042254.html,"It was bad, really mean  
She had the kind of reputation to make any woman scream  
Late one night, when it wasn't right  
And he made a catch and he met his match  
Black lady, black lady  
She was mean, really bad  
She was slender as a cat at night, she made the men go mad  
Well her eyes were green and her skin was soft  
And the lady's heart was as hard as rock  
Black lady, oh black lady  
You better beware, better beware  
Better beware, better beware, better beware, better beware  
You better beware, you better beware, ware  
Black lady's out to get you now  
Better beware, better beware, better beware, better beware  
Well he tried to fight it, tried to win  
But no matter where the poor man turned, the lady halted him  
Her wish was his command, his life in her hands  
And the death was slow 'cause she won't let go  
Oh, black lady, that black lady  
She tried to win, tried to buy  
She was all over him 'cause he played all the cards just right  
He laid out his hand like a winning man  
With a smile so deep, she put him into a sleep  
And you know she won  
Oh black lady, black lady  
You better beware, you better beware  
Ware, ware, ware, ware, ware,  
Ware, ware, ware, ware, ware, ware  
Black lady, you better beware  
Black lady, black lady, black lady, lady  
Well she tried to fight it, she just tried to win  
Black lady, you better beware  
Better beware, better beware, better beware, better beware

Donna Summer,Born To Die,/d/donna+summer/born+to+die_20042279.html,"Just a baby  
On a doorstep  
It's how they found me  
Cold and hungry  
Raised on hatred  
Fed by strangers  
As a young girl  
I often wondered  
  
[Chorus]  
Am I born to die  
Never having lived  
Am I born to die  
Without love  
In my life  
  
People push me  
Knock me down  
My foster parents  
Kicked me around  
They brought me up on  
Loneliness  
I never had me  
A single friend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Must be someone  
In this world  
Who can save me  
From myself  
  
Or am I born to die  
Never having lived  
Am I born to die  
Without love  
In my life  
  
[Chorus]

Donna Summer,Breakaway,/d/donna+summer/breakaway_20042195.html,"For too long she was feeling  
That her love had lost it meaning  
She was looking for a reason  
Not to breakaway  
But I don't think she can take it  
  
She'll be strong enough for two although  
It's hard for her to do  
She'll breakaway  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway  
  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
And breakaway  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway  
  
It's a secret she's been keeping  
It's been eating at her heart  
Wish I could find the words to tell you  
But I don't know where to start  
And when she looks into the future  
She sees too many problems  
There are so many reasons  
She should pack up the past  
And breakaway  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway  
  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
And breakaway  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway

""Do not be afraid Mary  
You have found favor with god  
You will be with child  
And give birth to a son  
And you are to give him the name Jesus  
He will be great  
And will be called the son of the most high  
And the lord god will give him the throne of his father David  
And he will reign over the house of David forever  
His kingdom will never end""

Cold and weary with a babe inside  
And I wonder what I've done  
Holy father you have come  
And chosen me now to carry your son  
  
I am waiting in a silent prayer  
I am frightened by the load I bear  
In a world as cold as stone  
Must I walk this path alone  
Be with me now  
Be with me now

Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven

Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For your are holy

Do you wonder as you watch my face  
If a wiser one should have had my place  
But I offer all I am  
For the mercy of your plan  
Help me be strong  
Help me be

Donna Summer,Domino,/d/donna+summer/domino_20042280.html,"Late last night at a fancy dress ball  
I was dancing with all the queens and lords  
When a tall and mystic man took me by the hand  
And began dancing my eyes away  
  
Domino, domino, domino  
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know  
Who's this masquerading lover  
I wish I could discover  
Domino, domino, domino  
  
I was feeling so dizzy and lame  
Was it champagne or really him to blame  
Though our faces were disguised  
Feelings couldn't hide  
That this wasn't just some kind of game  
  
Domino, domino, domino  
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know  
Who's this masquerading lover  
I wish I could discover  
Domino, domino, domino  
  
Domino who are you  
Domino I'd like to know  
Domino who's the real domino  
Though we're strangers still  
It's real love I feel domino  
  
Then at midnight the bells were all rung  
And he kisses me and held me in his arms  
Then a crowd would ride between us  
Trapped away my stranger  
And I never did find him again  
  
Domino, domino, domino  
Who's this man behind the mask I'd like to know  
Who's this masquerading lover  
I wish I could discover  
Domino, domino, domino
