Donna Summer,Don't Cry For Me Argentina,/d/donna+summer/dont+cry+for+me+argentina_20042264.html,"This won't be easy  
You'll think it's strange  
When I try to explain how I feel  
That I still need your love  
After all that I've done  
  
You won't believe me  
All you will see is a girl you once knew  
Although she's dressed up to nines  
For sixes and sevens with you  
  
I had to let it happen  
I had to change  
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window  
Staying out of the sun  
So I choose freedom  
Running around, trying everything new  
But nothing impressed me at all  
I never expected it too  
  
Don't cry for me, Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance  
  
And as for fortune  
And as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it appeared to the world  
They were all I desired  
They are illusions  
They're not the solutions they promised to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you, and hope you love me  
  
Don't cry for me, Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise,  
Don't keep your distance  
I kept my promise  
Don't keep your distance

Hits the steering wheel to tryin'  
Tune the radio out loud  
  
He heard Jobim say,  
And his heart began to sway  
He didn't think of anything

He would always take good care of me

Friends that's what we are just  
Friends no more or less oh  
Here we are sharing so much fun  
Friends why can't he see that I want him  
To be more than my friend  
  
Years have come and gone  
Still our friendship's strong  
Now he's more than just the boy next door  
  
I'm in love with him  
Guess I've always been  
He doesn't know he's all I'm living for

I'd like to tell him that I need him bad  
But I'm afraid if I do I might lose  
The only friend that I have

Early Sunday morning around breakfast time  
I heard a sudden tapping at the kitchen door  
Oh and there was more  
Well it was you I saw  
No mistake  
I knew you'd come around that sad look on your face  
Then you begged me to come in and I said yes  
Oh what a fool I am  
I should have turned away  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
To let it all hang out  
To fight my fear and fight my doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
(get ahold) of love  
Spoken words don't mean enough  
No mistake  
Remember not to break the promise that you make  
I'll meet you fifty fifty in the middle now  
And I won't back out  
There'd better be no doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love would bring you to my door  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love was on our side  
I love you you know I  
You know I always will love you now  
I know I do love you  
You know I'll always be true to you my love  
Here you stand  
Torn up yellow T-shirt and guitar in hand  
I wanna love you now  
Oh forget the past  
I wanna make love last  
I need time

Champagne was flowing, and so I let myself go,  
And when the night was over, we both looked around the room,  
Remember darling, chairs on the table, and only me and you

To hurt me with goodbye

Donna Summer,Love's Unkind,/d/donna+summer/loves+unkind_10087856.html,"Well I seem him every morning in the schoolyard  
When the school bell rings  
And when he passes in the hallway  
Well he doesn't seem to notice me  
  
He's got a crush on my best friend  
But she don't care, 'cause she loves someone else  
I'm standing on the outside, no the inside where I wanna be  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
'Cause he's not mine  
  
Just the other day I was praying that he'd give me a chance  
Hoping he would choose me for his partner  
For the high school dance  
I was standing outside the class  
  
But it wasn't me, but my best friend, he asked  
I went running back inside teary-eyed  
And left the two of them behind  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
'cause he's not mine  
  
Oh, how I love him, but I can't even let him know  
'cause he loves my best friend  
But she don't care, she loves someone else  
And I asked my mama, and she said: love's unkind  
  
Love's so unkind  
She said: just keep it alive  
'Cause you may find love's unkind  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
  
Oh, Why did I have to love him so  
Why did I have to love him so

He pulled up in a cloud of smoke  
So much was said  
But nobody spoke a word  
  
So I took a chance  
And he followed me home  
I knew he wouldn't beg  
So I gave in without fighting  
  
Been so long since I've been this way  
Since I loved this way  
So I asked him if he would stay for a while  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky  
You'll go for a ride  
For a ride  
  
We talked a while  
And he told me nice  
We laughed and we cried and  
I knew that I could love him  
He got up to say goodbye  
I said where you going,  
He said that he must leave  
  
Lucky comes easy  
Lucky's not shy  
And if you're lucky

Donna Summer,Lush Life,/d/donna+summer/lush+life_20042244.html,"I used to visit the very gay places  
Those come what may places  
Where one relaxes on the axis  
Of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life  
From jazz and cocktails  
  
All the men I knew had sad and  
Sullen gray faces  
With distingue traces  
That used to be there  
You could see where  
They'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales  
  
Then you came along with your  
Siren song  
To tempt me to madness  
I knew all the while  
That your poignant smile  
Was tinged with the sadness of a  
Great love for me  
Oh, yes I was wrong  
Again I was wrong  
  
Now life is lonely again  
And only last year everything  
Seemed so sure  
Now life is awful again  
A troughful of hearts would only  
Be a bore  
A week in Paris will ease the bite  
Of it  
But all I really care  
Is to smile in spite of it  
I'll forget you  
I will and yet you are still  
Burning inside my brain  
  
Romance is mush, stifling those  
Who strive  
I'll live a lush life in some  
Small dive  
And there I'll be  
While I rot with the rest  
Of those whose lives are  
Lonely too

Someone left the cake out in the rain  
I don't think that I can take it

And I'll never have that recipe again

Foaming like a wave  
On the ground beneath your knees  
The birds, like tender babies in your hands  
And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees

Donna Summer,Mimi's Song,/d/donna+summer/mimis+song_20042299.html,"Spoken:  
You know tonight is a very important night  
For me for a number of reasons  
My little girl is here tonight  
And I don't think you understand  
What it's like being the daughter of  
Someone who's always gone  
It's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely  
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes  
""Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?""  
And so my daughter looked up at me  
Last week and she said ""mummy  
When are you just gonna stay home  
One day and be with me""?  
And so it kinda struck me funny  
And I didn't realize that I hadn't spent  
Anytime with her for a long time  
So I sat down and wrote down this song  
After she went to bed  
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime  
I would sing her son  
I bet you ask yourself  
Why I'm never there  
It's not because I like being away  
You see I've made a spectacle of myself  
And it seems that the whole world needs me  
I understand when you cry alone  
And mama's not there to wipe your eyes  
You see it's only because  
I'm out being someone to make you cry  
I got a little letter  
And I read it on the plane  
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain  
I wish that I could be there  
To touch your face again  
Mimi you're beautiful  
Mimi you're mine  
And other things that I do in my life  
Seem to take up all your precious time  
There's so much I long to say  
So much more I long to do  
But I guess it's all just have to wait  
Till I can get to see you  
Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you fill my life  
You fill my life with so much love  
Cause you're beautiful  
And you love me  
And you'll understand  
Mimi it's bedtime say Goodnight  
""Goodnight""

And he'll be rich and strong

And fighting, breaking my best dishes

If you want me to be strong  
I'll give it everything I have  
You'll never have to worry  
'Cause we're not in a hurry  
On my honor I will try  
  
It's a lover's dance  
In a fiery chant  
Don't be afraid to face the music now  
It's a gambler's chance  
Not a lost romance  
And I'm not you  
And you're not me and  
Sometimes we feel differently  
  
On my honor I will try  
Always do the best I can  
Though the tears  
May fall like drops  
From my eyes honey  
On my honor I will try  
If you want me to be strong  
  
I'll give it everything I have  
You'll never have to worry  
'Cause we're not in a hurry  
On my honor I will try  
I will try  
I will try  
I'll try

Donna Summer,On The Radio,/d/donna+summer/on+the+radio_20042369.html,"Someone found a letter you wrote me, on the radio  
And they told the world just how you felt  
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat  
They never said your name  
But I knew just who they meant.  
  
Whoa I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too  
If by chance you heard it for yourself  
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you  
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air  
  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh  
On the radio  
Whoa oh oh oh  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh  
  
Now, now  
Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song  
Things are not the same since we broke up last June  
The only thing that I want to hear is that you love me still  
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon  
  
Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah  
And it made me feel proud when I heard you say  
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself  
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel  
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air  
  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh

Whoa, oh, oh  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh

Whoa oh oh

If you think that love isn't found on the radio  
Well tune right in you made find the love you lost  
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago  
It sounded really loud , they said it really loud

I was so sure that love had led me to your door  
Was it a dream, nothing more  
  
Inside my head  
I keep hearing all the tender words we said  
Who were they for  
  
We are strong  
We can hold on to each other if we try  
And make it right, for you and I  
There's no goodbyes  
  
Only the fool survives  
Only the heart provides  
Sweet love and tenderness  
Save us tonight  
  
Life is change  
But I never want to leave this love behind  
We've come too far to lose this time  
  
Where there's love  
There is nothing strong enough to come between  
What we believe  
And break us up where there is love  
  
Only the fool survives  
Only the heart provides  
Sweet love and tenderness  
Save us tonight  
  
Only the fool survives  
Even the hardest times  
Let all the love we share  
Keep us alive  
  
See your eyes in a million faces  
See your smiles in a thousand places  
And I never escape your memories  
  
You'd be there everywhere that I go  
You're the only real thing I know  
And I never wanted to be free  
Stay here with me

When all hope inside had die  
The he took the meaning back  
And left me feeling oh disillusioned  
He just walked out of my world  
Like you'd walk out of a room

Like a sad song  
Saying love was just a word  
Used to keep you hanging there  
Like a sad song  
You swallowed all those promises  
So called upon you are  
And following his footsteps

I know we both won't say a word

You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man  
That comes home with candy  
And flowers sayin' ""come on put on your dancing shoes  
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine""

That comes home fussing  
And fighting, breaking my best dishes  
And beat my head outside the wall  
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all

Something warm is turning inside of me  
Something warm is burning inside of me

Donna Summer,(Theme) Once Upon A Time,/d/donna+summer/theme+once+upon+a+time_20506811.html,"(Voice monologue over ""Once Upon A Time"" instrumental)  
  
Once upon a time, there was a girl  
She lived in the land of never-never  
Where everything real is unreal  
And only fairy tales come true  
Something like me and you  
  
But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real  
So she strived on to make it come true  
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her  
Never giving up the hope within her  
  
She carried on and on, because she believed  
That once, once in a time in her lifetime  
The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning, one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
'cause I believe, I believe  
  
And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love  
  
Once upon a time, in the land of never-never  
Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved

Livin' in hotel Imperial  
Met this man, he was something  
Very strange  
Said he was a spy from somewhere  
Else way far away  
He told me things about myself that  
I could tell nobody else  
Passed this message on to me, said  
Spirits move in secrecy  
I could almost read the man's mind  
Waitin' for the right sign  
I really wanna know if I'm gonna go  
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in  
Tokyo  
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo  
He passed this message on to me  
Said spirits move in secrecy  
A double agent amnesty  
An Ian Fleming mystery  
I, I know I read the man's mind  
I know I got the right sign  
I really wanna know if I'm gonna go  
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in  
Tokyo  
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo  
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in  
Tokyo  
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo

And I wonder where you've gone  
Thinking back on the happy hours just before the dawn  
Outside the wind is blowin'  
It seems to call your name again  
Where have you gone  
City streets and lonely highways  
I travel down  
My car is empty and the radio just seems to bring me down  
I'm just tryin' to find me  
A pretty smile that I can get into  
It's true, I'm lost without you  
  
Another lonely park, another Sunday  
Why is it life turns out that way  
Just when you think you got a good thing  
It seems to slip away  
  
It's warm outside, no clouds are in the sky  
But I need a place to go and hide  
I keep it to myself  
I don't want nobody else  
To see me cryin' all those tears in my eyes  
  
Another park, another Sunday  
Why is it life turns out that way  
Just when you think you got a good thing  
It seems to slip away  
Another park, another Sunday  
It's dark and empty thanks to you  
I got to get myself together  
But it's hard to do

Need a lady

Come with me and surely we'll be free

Wishing for some lovin' arms to hold me tight  
But it's always down to my old guitar  
That's all that keeps me from the bars

Lonely by the day  
Drifting late at night

Girls in garages, stripped  
Out to get liquor and clothes  
Half gallons of wine and six-packs of beer  
Jumped, humped, born to suffer  
Made to undress in the wilderness.  
I will never treat you mean  
Never start no kind of scene  
I'll tell you every place and person that I've been.

Always a bridesmaid on the verge of fame or over

One a friend, the other, the young one, a newer stranger

Poor boys thighs and buttock scarred by a father's belt

Story of her boyfriend, of teenage stoned death games  
Handsome lad, dead in a car  
Confusion  
No connections  
Come 'ere

Peace on earth  
Will you die for me?  
Eat me  
This way

If you'll only show me Far Arden again.  
I'm surprised you could get it up

Haven't I been through enough? she asks  
Now dressed and leaving  
The Spanish girl begins to bleed  
She says her period  
It's Catholic heaven  
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck  
My chest is hard and brown  
Lying on stained, wretched sheets with a bleeding virgin  
We could plan a murder  
Or start a religion.

Yeah, we broke through the window  
Yeah, we knocked on the door  
Her phone would not answer  
Yeah, but she's still home  
  
Now her father has passed over  
And her sister is a star  
And her mother smokes diamonds  
And she sleeps out in the car  
  
Yeah, but she remembers Chicago  
The musicians and guitars  
And grass by the lake  
And people who laugh'd  
And made her poor heart ache

The dark one, Enterprise  
We talked and they told me this story  
Now listen to this  
I'll tell you about Texas radio and the big beat  
Soft driven, slow and mad  
  
Reaching your head with the cold, sudden fury of a divine messenger

Wandering, wandering in hopeless night

The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well  
With the magic of a broom

With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there  
And a dustpan for the cinders  
With a rub rub here and a rub rub there  
She can polish up the winders  
  
Then presto chango  
Suddenly, the sun comes shining through  
And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?  
How d'you do?  
  
It makes you blink, to stop and think  
A woman and a whisk-broom  
Can accomplish so darn much  
So never under-estimate a woman's touch  
  
A woman's touch can quickly fill  
The empty flower boxes on a window sill  
One smile from her and zoom  
Little buds begin to bloom  
  
A touch of paint, a magic nail  
Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale  
Even make the lamp appear  
Like a crystal chandelier  
  
With a tack tack here and a tack tack there  
And a hand around a hammer  
With a mop mop here and a mop mop there  
You can give a cabin glamour  
  
Then gosh, almighty, all at once  
The cabin that we knew  
Becomes a shining castle built for two  
Me and you  
  
The pies and cakes a woman bakes  
Can make a fella tell her  
That he loves her very much  
So never under-estimate a woman's touch

But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home you'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, dear, we're still goodbying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow

Doris Day,Love Me Or Leave Me,/d/doris+day/love+me+or+leave+me_20668505.html,"This affair is killin' me  
I can't stand uncertainly  
Tell me now I've got to know  
Whether you want me to stay or to go  
  
Love me or leave me  
Or let me be lonely  
You won't believe me, I love you only  
I'd rather be lonely  
Then happy with someone else  
  
You might find the night time  
The right time for kissin'  
But night time is my time  
For just reminiscin'  
Regrettin' instead of forgettin'  
With somebody else  
  
There'll be no one  
Unless that someone is you  
I intend to be independently blue  
I want your love  
But I don't want to borrow  
To have it today to give it back tomorrow  
For your love is my love  
There's no love for nobody else

Doris Day,Lover Come Back,/d/doris+day/lover+come+back_20851274.html,"Fun may be fun  
But it's not when the one  
That you love has gone  
  
I try to sleep  
But the counting of sheep  
Goes on and on  
  
Without your kiss  
I just cannot exist  
From the night til dawn  
  
Lover, lover, lover  
Come back  
  
You had me where  
I was walking on air  
Never touched the ground  
  
Now I have learned  
There's a torch to be burned  
Since you're not around  
  
I'm gonna place  
An ad in the space  
Under lost and found  
  
Lover, lover, lover  
Come back  
  
I'm like a birdy without it's wings  
Like a pupper without it's strings  
I'm not anything without you  
  
Thinking about you  
Being without you  
Is what it took  
  
Now I'm all set  
Gonna go out and get you  
By hook or crook  
  
Whoever said they  
Like crawling in bed  
With a real good book  
  
I've made my conclusion  
I know what I lack  
There's no substitution  
So please hurry back  
  
Lover, lover, lover  
Lover, lover, come on back  
Come on back, lover, come back

Doris Day,Lullaby Of Broadway,/d/doris+day/lullaby+of+broadway_20237389.html,"Come on along and listen to  
The lullaby of Broadway  
The hip hooray and ballyhoo  
The lullaby of Broadway  
The rumble of a subway train  
The rattle of the taxis  
The daffodils who entertain  
At Angelo's and Maxi's  
  
When a Broadway baby says good night  
It's early in the morning  
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight  
Until the dawn  
  
Good night, baby  
Good night, the milkman's on his way  
Sleep tight, baby  
Sleep tight, let's call it a day  
Hey!  
  
The band begins to go to town  
And everyone goes crazy  
You rock-a-bye your baby round  
'Til everything gets hazy  
Hush-a-bye, I'll buy you this and that  
You hear a daddy saying  
And baby goes home to her flat  
To sleep all day  
  
Good night, baby  
Good night, the milkman's on his way  
Sleep tight, baby  
Sleep tight, let's call it a day  
  
Listen to the lullaby  
Of old... Broad... way...

They've burst your pretty balloon  
And taken the moon away  
It's time to wind up the masquerade  
Just make your mind up  
The piper must be paid  
  
The party's over, the candles flicker and dim  
You danced and dreamed through the night  
It seemed to be right just being with him  
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end  
Take off your makeup, the party's over  
It's all over, my friend

I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill  
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, just save that for your shit  
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit  
Like Soulja, I thought I told yah, you didn't listen  
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician  
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Meyers  
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'  
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic  
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

I'm old, you gotta know  
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold  
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes  
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll  
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again  
You know the truth, this not pretend, I'm not your friend  
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'  
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public  
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again

I'm so fucking dumb I wrote ""diamonds"" on my thumbs,  
It's a diamond on my dick so that's a diamond on her tongue,  
I can't feel you baby 'cause I'm romantically numb,  
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,  
There's nothing on the God's sun that I haven't done,  
I got a lot of problems gettin pussy just isn't one,  
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,  
Now they like potato chips I just cannot have one,  
And I might like you for a minute,  
But I don't like your friends in my business,  
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,  
Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Uh uhhhhhhh,  
I know you say you love me girl,  
I know you say you love me girl,  
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,  
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you,  
  
[Drake:]  
Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,  
I'm all-star team Jordan, small forward,  
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,  
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,  
How, How? Fuck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,  
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go,  
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,  
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for,  
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jae and Mack agree,  
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,  
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me,  
Wondering if I'm the best, Will I. Am, no Black Eyed Peas,  
Girls wanna fuck ya niggas, guy don't wanna be you,  
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,  
I feel like I'll find a wife exactly when I need to,  
You can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,

Uh uhhhhhhh,

We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it  
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it

I be over there, shawty I be over there  
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there  
And you don't even have to ask twice,  
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice  
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life  
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life  
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on  
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong  
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along  
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that tank shit,  
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk  
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture  
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister  
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue  
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial  
She call me the referee cause I be so official  
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle  
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,  
And who told you to put them jeans on  
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on  
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on  
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot  
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot  
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop  
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot  
  
Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted  
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it  
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it  
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it

Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedastool  
Are we moving too fast?  
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past

Is anything I'm doing brand new?  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
  
This here is something personal  
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible  
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know  
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside  
So I don?t ever question you and damn  
I can't even find, the perfect brush  
So I can paint what's going through my mind  
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind  
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?  
  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
Is anything I'm doing brand new?  
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new  
Brand new girl  
  
Is anything I'm doing brand new  
Is everything I'm doing too late  
  
Did he take off your clothes off just like this  
Did he give you loving just like this  
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date  
Tell me baby am I too late?
