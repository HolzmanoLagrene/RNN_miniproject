Went from my nigga serving it by the tele  
To venues in Manchester just swerving with Balotelli  
The fuck are you trying to tell me?  
Bothers me when you got to play therapist  
That shit's embarrassin'  
They even bring up these niggas make the comparison  
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150  
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy  
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney  
Selling under 150 you niggas gotta be kidding  
Is this even still a discussion?  
Don't you ever wake up disgusted?  
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin  
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became somethin'  
Girls that becoming ladies  
And my friends are having babies  
And babies are dropping dead in my city  
This shit is crazy  
And I don't know if speaking on it helps  
This the shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself  
You know  
  
Can't you talk to me  
Lets talk about it, talk about it  
Tell me what you need  
Just tell me baby, tell me baby

Overdosed on confidence

Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness  
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that  
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that  
I had someone tell me I fell off, oh I needed that  
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at  
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that  
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that  
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that  
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that  
No, don't do it, please don't do it, cause one of us goes in

Now it's something they know

Tell her I apologize it happened over time  
She says they missed the old Drake, girl don't tempt me  
If they don't get it, they'll be over you  
That new shit that you got is overdue  
You better do what you suppose to do  
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's
true  
Listen to you expressing all them feelings  
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children  
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing  
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions  
You know the game even got it like that

Been a minute since we kicked it  
You been caught up  
With these chicks and I don't get it, you're a star love  
You shouldn't have to deal with that  
I never make you feel like that  
Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us

Darlin' you, you give but you cannot take love.

I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement  
I want to take it deeper than money, vacation  
And influence a generation that's lackin' in patience  
I've been dealin' with my dad, speakin' of lack of patience  
Just me and my old man gettin' back to basics  
We've been talkin' 'bout the future and time that we wasted  
When he put that bottle down, girl that man is amazin'  
Well, we had a couple Coronas  
We might have rolled a white paper, just somethin' to hold us  
We even talked about you in our couple of moments  
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups  
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone  
Lookin' like you came from the 70's on your own  
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is  
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?  
You don't even know what you want from love anymore  
I search for somethin' I'm missin', it disappear when I'm bored  
But girl, what qualities was I lookin' for before?  
Who you settlin' for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

All my exes live in texas like I'm george strait  
Or they go to georgia state where-  
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in atlanta  
That she only see when she feels obligated  
Admitted it to me the first time we dated  
But she was no angel, and we never waited  
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck  
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it  
And we never talk too much after I blew up  
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'  
And I think I text her and told her I made it  
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it  
And that's when I text her and told her I love it  
And right after texting, told her I'm faded  
She asked  
What have I learned since getting richer  
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures  
I learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture  
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya  
Damn, is it the fall  
Time for me to revisit the past  
It's women to call  
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved  
There's stories to tell, we been through it all  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions  
Like:  
  
[Bridge: lil wayne]  
Do you love this shit?  
Are you high right now?  
Do you ever get nervous?  
Are you single?  
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?  
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?  
And I say  
  
(And I say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Fuckin' right, all right  
(And we say) hell yeah  
Hell yeah, hell yeah  
Fuckin' right  
Fuckin' right, all right  
  
[Lil wayne]  
So much for being optimistic  
They say love is in the air, so I  
Hold my breath until my face turn purple  
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle  
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew  
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you  
I flew jet, she flew commercial  
But we still met, later that night  
After my session, she came over  
I was aggressive, and she was sober  
I gave her pills  
She started confessing and started undressing  
And ask me to hold her  
And so I did, but that was last month  
And now she's texting me, asking for closure  
Damn  
She say this shit gon' catch up to me  
I keep tissue paper  
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table  
She say she hate that she love me  
And she wish I was average  
Shit, sometimes I wish the same  
And I wish she wasn't married  
Promises, I hope I never break 'em  
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like  
  
[Bridge:]  
Do you love this shit?  
Are you high right now?  
Do you ever get nervous?  
Are you single?  
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?  
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?

20 thousand for a verse, is our routine quote  
I'm getting rich, aah, you staying broke  
Chilling if even if I'm in a goosed down coat  
I cant' see you through the Mosley Tribes  
So I don't even flinch when you throw me hi fives  
They try to measure up, but there's no my size  
Whatever 40 smokin bout to low my eyes  
Beast mode on them, a never take a night off  
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off  
Grounded as the one way pavement am taking flight off  
Baby go ahead and cut the lights off  
Cuz It's about to go...  
  
Beat plays  
  
I hear ma phone ringing when they call  
I aint picking up or entertaining them at all  
Got your girl face down and banging on the wall  
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall  
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmmmmm  
I cannot relate  
Riding with some tags that a got from out-a-state  
Riding with a swag that a got from out-a-space  
Just show me who's the hottest Ima knock him out his place  
Call me homeside drizzy, about to kill your ego  
I'm about ma green, puffin goody like I'm celo  
You can go and take a glance at your hero  
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero  
Fantasy to you, reality to me  
And yeah ma g-pass is as valid as can be  
I'm, I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree  
Waving at your girl  
While she's smiling back at me like...

Drake,Karaoke,/d/drake/karaoke_20534833.html,"Things have been so crazy and hectic, I should have got her back by now  
But you know how much I wanted to make it, It's probably better anyhow  
So if you gotta go, if there's anything I should know  
If the spotlight makes you nervous  
If you're looking for a purpose  
You put the tea in the kettle and light it  
Put your hand on the metal and feel it  
But do you even feel it anymore?  
I remember when you thought I was joking  
Now I'm off singing karaoke  
Farther than I've ever been  
So if you gotta go, if there's any way I can help  
  
Isn't it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner?  
And tells me that my life is too much and moves to Atlanta? Damn  
Of all the places you could go  
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know  
I'm always up too late, I worry about you there alone  
And that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron  
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy  
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories about his lady  
I know they say the first love is the sweetest  
But that first cut is the deepest  
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets  
You were telling everybody but me  
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky  
I'm surprised you couldn't tell  
  
I was only trying to get ahead  
I was only trying to get ahead  
But the spotlight makes you nervous  
And you're looking for a purpose  
I was only trying to get ahead  
I was only trying to get ahead  
But the spotlight makes you nervous

Drake,Light Up,/d/drake/light+up_20889420.html,"I've been up for four days  
Getting money both ways  
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades  
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades  
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age  
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you  
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true  
Cause while all of my closest friends out partying  
I'm just here making all the music that they party to  
But party on, party on, all night nigga  
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga  
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars  
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire  
Uh, but I just wanna tell the truth  
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot  
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park  
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose  
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target  
But a target nonetheless and I just started  
Was that directed at moi? Can't be  
They must be talking to themselves hoe, hands free  
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner  
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner  
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music  
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar  
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you  
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,  
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you  
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit' you  
Don't get impatient when it takes too long  
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong  
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me  
Promise to always give you me, the real me  
  
Who would have thought  
I'd be caught in this life?  
Let's celebrate with a toast  
And get lost in tonight  
And make it all light up  
(Hey, Guru, tell home girl to go to open that Ace right there),  
Wait until the sun goes down  
We gon' make this bitch light up  
Even when the sun goes down  
I'm gon' make this go  
  
Ow, hoes turn they heads like, owls  
I'm the man of the hour  
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how  
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power  
Bright life'd make your whole city light up  
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub  
I just landed in that G450  
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy  
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk  
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk  
I don't do too much blogging  
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'  
(Uh) I ain't got a scar yet  
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched  
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you  
Will silly raps feuds tryin' to distract you  
In disguise, in the form of a favor  
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors  
(Uh) I done seen it all, done it all  
That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off  
The summer's ours, the winter too  
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do  
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7  
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you  
And since no good deed go unpunished  
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was  
I once was, cool as The Fonz was  
But these bright lights turned me to a monster  
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me  
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me  
Fuck niggas, bitches too  
All I got is this money, this'll do  
  
Who would have thought  
I'd be caught in this life?  
Let's celebrate with a toast

Drake,Make Me Proud,/d/drake/make+me+proud_20986319.html,"I like a woman with a future and a past  
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last  
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast  
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that  
Only you can do it just like that  
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower  
Runnin' on a treadmill and only eating salad  
Sound so smart like you graduated college  
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard  
Knowin' you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool  
Couple things due but you always get it done  
Might have been a time when I loved her too  
But you take that away and you'll always be the one  
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl  
Maybe it's just right for the night  
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl  
They want you in their life as a wife  
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest  
Why you want to fight for your right  
'Cause you don't love them boys  
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise  
  
[Chorus]  
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go  
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?  
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine  
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time  
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back  
That's why you're bad as fuck and you  
  
B-b-b-b-bet I am  
All of them bitches I'm badder than  
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon  
But I never mention everything I dabble in  
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'  
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in  
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat  
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO  
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still  
The best legal team so the deals is ill  
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too  
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue  
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too  
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too  
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high  
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch  
  
But baby, if you ask me to take a break  
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say  
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away  
  
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'  
I'm a star, sheriff badge  
What's the point if I'm guarding?  
Double D up, hoes, Dolly Parton

I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back

Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense  
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?  
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?  
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man  
Aw man, aw man  
Aw, man

Me and you are playing house, start think that I'm losing touch  
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up  
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is  
Start to think I got to get it how I live  
We too busy for a wedding or a kid  
If I'm working then I know you working  
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous  
I empower girls that don't deserve it  
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose  
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is  
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

You don't ever come to where I stay  
You just rather stay up in your New York condo

Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?  
You know how sticky these situation get

I'm on my way tonight I hope you not the crazy type yeah  
I'm in your state tonight I might just break the bank tonight  
PND ain't with the ray tay tay  
You know Jay Ray  
Got girls her going way way way way way way  
Sauga city trip the pay day  
Load up off a gate way  
Man you can't afford me  
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story  
Niggas is all in their feelings these days, all in their feelings these days  
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes you should be afraid

Drake,Replacement Girl,/d/drake/replacement+girl_20420513.html,"(feat. Trey Songz)  
  
[Echo-Trey Songz]  
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement  
  
[Verse 1-Drake]  
Lat me show what it is  
I was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map  
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap  
If you lookin for the goods then we got in the trap like  
[Trey]  
Ooo wee  
[Drake]  
Took 'em from white snakes to  
[Trey]  
Ooo wee  
[Drake]  
This metaphore might sound a little confusing but  
[Trey]  
Yall don't really even know me yeah yeah  
[Drake]  
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that stayed in  
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at
amazing'  
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us  
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is  
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious  
What you really expect when I strut through town  
Two or three days I shut you down  
Chilin wit the homie Trey Songz  
You call him the prince he rep two up two down  
Anyone I know get used to me  
I'm far from the man that I used to be  
I don't ever really kick game  
I know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me  
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that  
Need good lovin' I'm providing that  
Understand that I'm worldwide  
You get who you want it wherever you be residing at  
'Cause I do things from the M-town  
To the uk  
From Spain back out to Texas  
This album's for my fans  
But yo this hook is for my exes  
  
[Chorus-Trey Songz]  
This one is for you girl  
You know who you are girl  
You only show you're face  
'Cause you know that I'm a star girl  
What you trying to to make it  
Don't ever mistake it  
'Cause my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you  
You had a chance now It's gone  
Oooooh  
You had a man now you don't  
Back to the basics  
I think I made it  
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl  
  
[Verse 2-Trey Songz]  
Ain't ya never seen a yougin so fly  
Lookin for someone your type  
I done left behind the love of my life  
Tryin to find another one tonight  
And if it's you baby  
Let yourself be seen  
Don matter skirts  
Dresses or jeans  
I got that work  
Know what I mean  
And I'm flexing on my ex if you know what mean  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3-Drake]  
Check this out  
From the that she get picked for some take out  
Until they slip up and break out  
But it's another story over here at Drake's house  
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out  
And I'm lean back  
Scoping  
Looking for a woman that I should wife  
Who got just the right amount of loyalty  
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life  
We go la, va  
Ny, to  
Sunshine in that heat stroke  
And them fur hoods in that deep snow  
We have breakfast in the bedroom  
Break bread downstairs in the basement  
Since Jay and Kelz ain't doing the thing no more  
Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay  
Ay, Ay, Ay  
Let's Go

And there's things you gotta go through  
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do  
And they never will  
  
[Verse 1]  
But I swear you gotta chill  
You wanna grip Benz wheel  
And I know you can't wait  
You dream big and sleep late  
You got a lot on your plate  
That's why you're always working out  
Taking pictures of yourself  
You don't see anybody else  
You're like oh well  
You're like fuck it oh well

Ok I know you want the Audi  
I know you want to go to Maui  
You and all your girlfriends  
The ones you never bring around me  
Cause you don't trust me like your last man  
Did he open doors for ya?  
Buy the things he can't afford for ya  
Cause he must have did a lot for ya  
I just fell back with it  
And now your past is behind you  
Like the car with the strap in it  
Thank god that's finished  
Cause now it's back to business  
Any more henny and you're past the limit  
You told me about the picture  
Now you have to send it  
I would never put you on blast when I get it

Drake,Runaway Girl,/d/drake/runaway+girl_20891156.html,"Hey there material girl  
The neighbors told me that you're moving out  
Leaving to witness the world  
But are you sure that's what you're doing now  
  
Are you running away for a purpose  
Do you even know what your self worth is  
The past what you carry in your purses  
The gift in the curse when you going head first is  
The atl, mia, lax, jfk  
Luggage all packed and to them I say  
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray  
  
You wander the world  
You seek what you've lost  
You're waking up every day  
The run away, run away girl  
I turn and your gone  
You're leaving to chase your fame  
The run away, the run away girl  
  
So long  
Farewell  
Good bye  
Good day  
Be on  
Your way  
Run away girl  
(X2)  
  
Watching it all through the window  
And wishing you could make is shatter now  
Now that you're here on the other side  
Are you sure it even matters  
  
Are you living the dream  
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems  
Do you strip do you model do you live in between  
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like  
  
You wander the world  
You seek what you lost  
You're waking up every day  
To run away, run away girl  
I turn and you're gone  
You're leaving to chase your fame  
You run away, run away girl  
  
So long  
Farewell  
Good bye

Be on your way

Drake,Say What's Real,/d/drake/say+whats+real_20782063.html,"Why do I feel so alone?  
Like everybody passing through the studio  
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role  
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know  
And I don't have the heart to give these  
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go  
So they stick around kicking out feedback  
And I entertain it as if I need that  
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that  
My privacy about the only thing I need back but  
It's hard to think of them polite flows  
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes  
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes  
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed  
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows  
Life was so full  
Now this shit just being lipo'd  
Always said I'd say it all on the right track  
But in this game you only lose when you fight back  
Black diamond bracelets  
Showing you the basics  
I can't live and hold the camara  
Someone gotta tape this  
I make hits unlike a bitch  
That's married I ain't miss  
24 hours from greatness  
I'm that close  
Don't ever forget the moment  
You began to doubt  
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out  
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South  
Watchin' whole show  
Embarrassed to pull my camera out  
And my mother embarrassed  
To pull my Phantom out  
So I park about 5 houses down  
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown  
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around  
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus  
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness  
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus  
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless  
And promoters try to get me out to they club  
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how  
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl  
Standing with my next girl  
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now  
And shit could get weird unless they all down  
And so I stay clear  
  
We from a small town  
Everybody talks and everybody listen  
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing  
I've always been something that these labels can't buy  
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my soul  
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez ""Damn Drake fly""  
And he just be like ""Silly mother fucker I know""  
That was your bad  
How could you pass up on 'em?  
He just take them records  
And he gas up on 'em  
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em  
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em  
Oh they did Po  
At least they tried to  
And that's what happens  
When you spitting what's inside you  
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video  
And they think they can market you  
However they decide to nahh  
But Forty told me to do me  
And don't listen to anybody that knew me  
'Cause to have known me would  
Mean that there's a new me  
And if you think I changed in the slightest  
Could of fooled me  
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3  
Drug dealers live vicariously through me  
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy  
I'm just not the social type  
And campus life is crazy understand  
I could get money with my eyes closed  
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo  
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll  
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know  
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will  
I got new shit  
I'm gettin' better still  
Little niggas put my name in they verses  
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal  
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill  
And I think this got this ""Making of a Legend"" feel  
Problem with these other niggas they  
Ain't never real  
Yea that's all I can say

Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions  
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions  
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra  
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son, tho  
Nothing mutual about my funds, bout my funds, tho  
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at  
How they feel about you, where you're from, where your bed at  
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that  
I make people pay me for my time, yeah I need that  
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time, tho

Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog  
I thought that we were family  
You showed me that we can't be  
I gotta talk to God even though he isn't near me  
Based on what I got it's hard to think that he don't hear me  
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted  
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
6 point star, Lion of the Judah  
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci  
One do it then we all gotta do it  
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it  
Whole city at your head for the boy  
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Drake,Stunt Hard,/d/drake/stunt+hard_20607367.html,"[Chorus]  
I did it all on my own,  
Turned a chair to a throne,  
I'm a king in this world,  
(Stunt hard)  
I put my whole city on,  
To some things that they never would've known,  
If I didn't,  
(Stunt hard)  
And every night is a premiere,  
If I ever disappear,  
Best believe I'm comin' back.  
(Stunt hard)  
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,  
On that same shit again,  
All I ever do is,  
(Stunt hard)  
  
(Drake):  
I tell her.  
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy.  
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy.  
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, ""Who Is He"",  
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy.  
And I'm focused on my survival.  
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival.  
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idols.  
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed.  
I'm everything you just haven't become.  
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done.  
Now hopefully let them see,  
What they say that I'm gon' be,  
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me.  
Get your team in order, assembly is key.  
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea.  
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be,  
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty.  
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard.  
But I'm just trying to swerve.  
Without hitting the curb.  
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them.  
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them.  
I am not them. I Photoshop them, out.  
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about.  
Yeah.  
The Chris Paul  
Of this fall,  
Sittin' this tall.  
I float high,  
Goodbye,  
I will miss y'all.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Lil' Wayne):  
If I don't do nothin', Imma stunt my ass off.  
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff.  
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off.  
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff.  
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stunt devil.  
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled.  
I'm a young rebel.  
And I got a baby face.  
I need a young pebbles.  
I need a stuntdouble.  
Yeah!  
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble.  
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles.  
Yeah!  
I stick my landin' in a freak drawers.  
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes.  
Yeah!  
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes  
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O.  
Yeah!  
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious.  
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious.  
Yeah!  
I'm on the cup of that tilt.  
And if you hatin' on me  
I'll say fuck you like wilt.  
Yeah!  
I'm a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast.  
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace.  
Yeah!  
Talkin' big big shit.  
I am rude,  
I take food,  
From a kid picnic.  
Nigga.  
Yeah!  
And we can bang like bumper cars.  
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all stunner bars.  
Haha.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Nutt Da Kid):  
I stunt hard. I stunt harder.  
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans.  
I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger.  
And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter.  
I hustle harder.  
I live in the Carter.  
I think forward,  
All I see is tomorrow.  
I need me.  
I'll turn your shop into a horror.  
So if you trying to see more  
Better feed me.  
I'm back on my grizzy like Izzy Efeger.  
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur.  
And the feds will never get me,  
Like a backwards,  
Password,  
Black spur,  
Go some like Pacman, cats first.  
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister  
Ask her,  
Am I their man,  
Her answer,  
Is yes sir.  
Shit.

'Bout a quarter a day.  
Now tell them bitches.

If you let me, here's what I'll do  
I'll take care of you  
I've loved and I've lost  
  
I've asked about you and they've told me things  
But my mind didn't change  
I still the feel the same  
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know  
We know, they don't get you like I will  
My only wish is I die real  
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal  
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still  
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case  
Big girls all get a little taste  
Pushing me away so I give her space  
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break  
I'll be there for you, I will care for you  
I keep thanking you, just don't know  
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that  
On your face girl, it just don't show  
When you're ready, just say you're ready  
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy  
And the parties over, just don't forget me  
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow  
You won't ever have to worry,  
You won't ever have to hide  
And you seen all my mistakes

It's my birthday, I get high if I want to  
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to  
Cause you don't say you love me  
To your friends when they ask you  
Even though we both know that you do (you do)  
One time, been in love one time  
You and all your girls in the club one time  
All so convinced that you're following your heart  
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes  
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed  
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know  
We know,  
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one  
You hate the fact that you bought the dream  
And they sold you one  
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you  
Instead they say  
  
Know you've been hurt by someone else  
I can tell by the way you carry yourself  
If you let me, here's what I'll do

Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around  
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down  
I don't waste time putting money down  
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash  
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first
class  
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city  
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever  
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it  
  
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell  
I will never understand that but oh well  
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you  
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""  
Okay, now you're talking my language, now you're talking my language  
Now you're talking my language, now you're talking my language  
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you  
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said ""Girl, that's all that we do""  
  
I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited  
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited  
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence  
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do  
People are funny you don't even know about the shit that I been through  
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple  
Talking that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me  
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to
me  
Hate when they get too attached to me  
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road  
Get what I can out the country and then I just get on the jet and go back to
the cold  
Can't even drive with the top off  
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer  
I just might bring in some girls from Miami  
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna, you know it  
  
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell  
I will never understand that but oh well  
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you

Famous and gangstas  
You understand me?

Big time, sunshine, tote nines  
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind  
High life, stay fly it's jet time  
Stunt nigga, every time you see a nigga  
Stunt nigga, every time you see a nigga  
Stunt nigga, swag on head to feet nigga  
Stunt nigga,  
I might just bring in some girls from Miami to heat up the city and that's
word to Stunna you know it

Drake,The Resistance,/d/drake/the+resistance_20884830.html,"Yesterday when we were getting high, you were invited.  
You would've liked it. I-I know you all too well.  
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye,  
But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.  
You can stay but shawty here I go  
  
Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas?  
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it.  
I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.  
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it.  
I am, still here with who I started with.  
The game needed life, I put my heart in it.  
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit.  
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.  
Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.  
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.  
It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a florist,  
And that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous.  
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.  
I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.  
Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.  
I'm trying to do better than good enough.  
  
[Chorus]  
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.  
But people I don't have the time to hang with,  
Always look at me and say the same shit (they say)  
You promised me you would never change.  
You promised me you would never change.  
  
Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.  
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.  
Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.  
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.  
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.  
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.  
But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,  
That I barley know at all and,  
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected  
Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.  
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.  
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is,  
I'm holding on by a thread it's,  
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now,  
And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.  
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,  
'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.  
The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.  
Which made me question when I went missing.  
And when I start treating my friends different.  
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.  
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.  
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.  
Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.  
I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.  
I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets.  
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.  
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.  
Did I just trade free time for camera time?  
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?  
I just need some closure.  
Ain't no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.

Drake,The Search,/d/drake/the+search_21057247.html,"(Feat. Saukrates)  
  
[Intro: Saukrates]  
(They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all)  
  
[Verse 1: Drake]  
Hip-Hop's newest and youngest acquisition,  
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position.  
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference,  
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen.  
I go from records with Dwele and LB and eLZhi,  
The meetings where they tell me to  
Start making records and t hey'll buy,  
Now I'm at in A-Town,  
A tellin' me trey sounds,  
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' a-round.  
But the allure of this year's scream tour  
Has been cuttin' all them jawns that be hurtin' the game.  
I be dreamin' bout hoes and doin' them loud shows,  
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train.  
Dog, personally maine,  
I'm a person that came to bring purpose  
To a seem unless they purpose is game.  
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame,  
Now my thoughts getting' deeper and I'm searchin' the game,  
I keep on, on, on, on, on  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Yeah) I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all  
(Yeah) I'm killin' 'em all, all  
I'm killin' 'em all, all  
  
[Verse 2: Saukrates]  
Yeah.  
Let me show you how to blast up,  
Now tell me who is a masta.  
A mind never wasted,  
Who grows fasta.  
The young and incredible while lightin' yo ass up,  
You look a lil red, we getting that cash up.  
See where we from,  
The 50s are bloody and the 100-dollar bill  
Is dirty brown they love me.  
I mess up my livin' room, the studio with my money,  
A g-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of,  
My lapel, is custom-made,  
You off the rack shit,  
I'm off the chain, come on.  
The dogs are loose,  
And yeah we get at themon like san frisco bay,  
With 40 and mac dre.  
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to  
Me or one of my folk,  
Drake'll give you the deal.  
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills,  
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill.  
Keep on, keep on (uh), keep on (uh), keep on (uh)  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Yeah) I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all  
(Yeah) I'm killin' 'em all, all  
I'm killin' 'em all, all  
  
[Verse 3: Drake]  
Look, uh  
I use to get 'em like murda murda,  
Ol' time killin'.  
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin',  
And now the girls like,  
It's only drake got chased and so the artists  
I respected try and take my place,  
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin',  
They one in the same when you need it to happen.  
My city full of players they just needed a captain,  
In-need of him right now and needed him him back then.  
But back then I was act-in',  
Now-a-days I serve back-hands with back-spin.  
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men,  
Whoever chose to back out is back in,  
They say there's two sides to every story  
And three when the truth get told,  
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold.  
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old.  
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold.  
And keep on, on, on, on, on  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Yeah) I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all  
I'm killin' 'em all, all  
I'm killin' 'em all, all

Drake,Trust Issues,/d/drake/trust+issues_20915517.html,"All I care about is money and the city that I'm from  
I'ma sip until I feel it  
I'ma smoke until it's done  
I don't really give a fuck  
And my excuse is that I'm young  
And I'm only getting older  
Somebody shoula told ya  
I'm on one  
Fuck it I'm on one  
I said I'm on one  
Fuck it I'm on one  
A strong on  
2 white cups and I got that drink  
It could be purple it could be pink  
Depending on how you mix that shit  
Money to be gotten I'ma get that shit  
Cause I'm on one  
Fuck it I'm on one  
Ah yeah ah yeah  
  
You know what I like  
Oh yes oh yeah  
Oh yes oh yeah  
Oh yes oh yeah  
  
You know what I'm sippin  
I teach you how to mix it  
But you're the only one  
Cause I don't trust these bitches  
I don't I don't trust these bitches  
They might catch me slipping  
So you're the only one  
Cause I don't trust these bitches  
They might they might catch me slipping  
And put in something different  
So you're the only one  
Cause I don't trust these bitches

Drizzy drake check me out  
Coming live from the mu-fucking north side  
Kid game run game run it real good  
But never ever have my bitches sitting court side  
Same nigga that you knew way back when  
You acting like it's somebody you don't know  
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends  
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show  
I can tell I can tell I can tell certain people don't like me no more  
New shit don't excite me no more  
Guess they didn't really make 'em like me no more  
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself  
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself  
But still let them girls in  
And tell 'em all leave them cellphones on the table where we see 'em  
I'm all day wit' it man am to the pm  
Niggas hatin' I just wish that they would say it when we see 'em all  
  
That's that shit that drives me crazy  
And it's all that I've been getting lately  
And it's pro'ly why I'm scared to put the time in  
Women wanna fuck like that mean I'm them  
Looking for somethings and I think that I can find them  
In you in you

Drake,Try Harder,/d/drake/try+harder_21057240.html,"Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff  
Are the only ones with enough  
To feel what I'm about to say in this song  
When they want you to be like somebody else  
And you just wanna be yourself  
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong  
It is when all the press articles happening  
And the cameras get to snappin  
And they try to make you out as a lie  
Symbolic cos you were just trying to please em'  
By using logic and reason  
It's a lose lose why even try  
When your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected  
And They never really know how to feel  
Phone calls is something that you're expecting  
For someone without ethics to try and make em a mill  
You never noticed the fact you might be working what I'm receivin' at first  
And niggas wanna say that you ain't around  
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself (yourselves)  
Instead of claimin' that you couldn't help and maybe next time you were
(ain't) In town  
  
Chorus:  
You gonna try to try harder cos  
Try harder cos  
  
Try -Try-Try-Try  
  
And the managers make you circum to pressure  
And you spitin' the pressure than most of the rappers running the game  
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past  
And turn the profit to cash  
There's time I would have done it the same  
I mean I got me a range  
Also got me a guilty conscience  
That made you tell anybody I meet that I ran  
Sometimes I wish that I woulda' just chilled on the sneakers  
And watched the game from the bleachers  
Cos I'm really telling me what I spent  
In a house that I promised to get my mother  
Don't compensate for the other time  
I wasted late out at the club  
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner  
I working hard on the winner so this album is a labour of love  
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets  
And just spending money on beats that  
She can rest without a toss and a turn  
Cos she know that my reputation perceives me  
And people watch me on tv  
That's exactly why I often get burned  
But I'm gonna try to.

So I'm single thinking about what we had and missing you  
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too  
I mean paparazzi on me trying not to get caught out  
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out  
Baby don't hold on too long cause that's how them stories start out  
And all the girls that played me eat your motherfucking heart out, its Drizzy  
Always gone but never hard to find  
And since you can't escape me do I ever cross your mind  
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave  
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save  
But I'm good I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle  
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now  
Never forgetting from where I came  
And no matter where I'm headed  
I promise to stay the same (yeah, look)  
  
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down  
Ask your girl I'm the realest nigga she been around

So welcome to my life no two days the same  
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her names the game

I'll admit it if you just keep quiet  
Girl I'm lonely  
That shit ain't my fault girl  
Cause I'm lonely  
Name another woman, ain't no other woman who should come for me  
When I'm lonely  
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny  
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely  
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely

Heard you spend your summers in Miami  
At somebody's house  
That you didn't buy  
You're young so have fun girl  
I hope it's worth it  
Cause fuck it I'm not here to judge  
Fuck it I'm not here to love  
Everything you did to ball  
Fuck it, I'm just glad that you called  
Ring ring ring, what a thing  
Ring ring ring, school bell ring  
You and I got options there  
Name another woman  
Ain't no other woman that should come for me when I'm lonely

What if I kissed you right now  
How would we explain it  
Trying to imagine how it might sound  
If I just yelled out  
What if I kissed you right now  
Would it bring us any closer  
Take a weight off our shoulders  
Take me I'm yours  
And I don't really care who knows it  
Can you afford to be open with all these emotions  
If you were a secret how long could you keep it  
Lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com  
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else  
Not a problem [?]  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)  
  
What if I kissed you right now  
Would it bring us any closer  
Take a weight off of our shoulders  
Tell on me  
I don't mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie  
Admit that I'm yours  
I doon't really care who knows it  
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions  
  
If you were a secret how long could you keep it  
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else

Drake,Where Were You,/d/drake/where+were+you_21047058.html,"[Verse 1: drake]  
I have to watch the road  
I swear that every car that passes has you in it  
I can't believe we're finished  
My life is movin' fast  
The time will often pass  
And something will remind me  
I can't put this behind me  
I thought you would've called by now, by now  
You could've had my all by now, by now  
It's been too many years for you to disappear  
And have me asking the question  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you  
Although, I said all goodbyes  
And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
  
[Verse 2: dawn richard]  
I swear I heard you call  
But when I heard you'd gone  
I hate that I looked desperate  
You gone is like me naked  
I'm staring at your (?)  
Trying to make it last  
Keep looking close behind me  
My eyesight on a memory  
I thought you would've called by now, by now  
You could have all my love right now, by now  
Gave into my fears  
While you just disappeared  
That's why I'm asking this question...  
  
[Hook]  
I wonder whatever became of you  
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try  
It's not that I was frightened, of you  
Although, I said all goodbyes  
And, you had all your cries  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
I wonder whatever became of you  
  
[Verse 3: drake]  
I can't go to bed  
Thinking about my goals  
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline  
Where did the other half of my heart go?  
Why am I in bed alone?  
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?  
Do you even live there?  
Or did you take a u-haul?  
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?  
We were on fire  
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out  
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out  
  
[Hook]

Well, isn't it for the honor of god,  
Aunt Kate?  
I know all about the honor of god,

Six o'clock the siren kicks him from a dream  
Tries to shake it off but it just won't stop  
Can't find the strength but he's got promises to keep  
And wood to chop before he sleeps  
  
I may never get over  
But never's better than now  
I've got bases to cover  
  
He's in the parking lot and he's just sitting in his car  
It's nine o'clock but he can't get out  
He lights a cigarette  
And turns the music down  
But just can't seem to shake that sound  
  
Once I thought I'd get over  
But it's too late for me now  
I've got bases to cover  
  
Melody walks through the door  
And memory flies out the window  
And nobody knows what they want  
'til they finally let it all go  
  
The pain inside  
Coming outside  
  
So many ways to drown a man  
So many ways to drag him down  
Some are fast and some take years and years  
Can't hear what he's saying when he's talking in his sleep  
He finally found the sound but he's in too deep  
  
I could never get over  
Is it too late for me now?  
Feel like blowing my cover  
  
Melody walks through the door  
And memory flies out the window  
And nobody knows what they want  
'til they finally let it all go  
  
But don't cut your losses too soon  
'cause you'll only be cutting your throat  
And answer a call while you still hear at all  
'cause nobody will if you won't

Dream Theater,A Nightmare To Remember,/d/dream+theater/a+nightmare+to+remember_20789878.html,"I've got a nightmare to remember  
I'll never be the same.  
What began as laughter  
So soon would turn to pain.  
  
The sky was clear and frigid  
The air was thick and still  
Now I'm not one to soon forget  
And I bet I never will  
  
Picture for a moment  
The perfect irony  
A flawless new beginning  
Eclipsed by tragedy.  
  
The uninvited stranger  
Started dancing on his own  
So we said goodbye to the glowing bride  
And we made our way back home.  
  
Life was so simple then  
We were so innocent.  
Father and mother  
Holding each other.  
(Chug chug chug chug)  
  
Without warning  
Out of nowhere  
Like a bullet  
From the night  
  
Crushing glass  
Rubber and steel  
Scorching fire  
Glowing lights  
  
Screams of terror  
Pain of fear  
Sounds of sirens  
Smoke in my eyes  
  
Sudden stillness  
Wrapped in silence  
No more screaming  
No more cries  
  
Stunned and bewildered  
Cold and afraid  
Torn up and broken  
Frightened and dazed  
  
Stunned and bewildered  
Cold and afraid  
Torn up and broken  
Frightened and dazed  
  
Lying on the table  
In this unfamiliar place  
I'm greeted by a stranger  
A man without a face  
  
He said, ""Son do you remember?  
Do you even know your name?""  
Then he shined a light into my eyes  
And said, ""take this for the pain.""  
  
Hopelessly drifting,  
Bathing in beautiful agony.  
I am endlessly falling,  
Lost in this wonderful misery.  
  
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake  
And thought of the panic inside starts to fade.  
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony.  
  
""Tell me does this hurt you?""  
Said the faceless man.  
""Can you move all of your fingers?  
Can you try your best to stand?""  
  
I asked about the others  
""Is everyone okay?""  
He told me not to worry  
As he turned and looked away.  
  
Hopelessly drifting,  
Bathing in beautiful agony.  
I am endlessly falling,  
Lost in this wonderful misery.  
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake  
And thought of the panic inside starts to fade.  
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony.  
  
Day after day  
And night after night  
We burden the oppressed  
Did they ever see the red light?  
  
Over and over  
Scene by scene  
Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams.  
How could you prepare  
  
For what would happen next?  
The search you'll never have to see  
Hi father such a mess.  
It's a miracle he lived  
  
It's a blessing no one died  
By the grace of God above  
Everyone survived  
  
Life was so simple then  
We were so innocent.  
It will stay with us forever  
A nightmare to remember

Boundless energy  
Euphoria fixation  
  
Still talk to just get by  
Seems so meaningless to try  
When all I want to do is cry  
Who would ever know I felt so sad  
  
'Cause even though I get so high  
I know that I will never fly  
And when I fall out of the sky  
Who'll be standing by?

Never be crippled by chaos and doubt  
Fall prey to your madness  
  
I am not shattered  
Out of the ashes I rise  
Knowing that nothing is stronger than faith  
Finding hope in our hopeless lives

Lest he stop her from the deed

Your grim request I shall heed!""

Idol and best friend

Trust me, you will be the chosen one  
  
I was forgotten, my body scorned and broken  
My soul rejected, taketh by his blood  
Your redemption, a sinner not worth saving  
Forever taken from the one I loved  
  
Do I still wait for my god  
And a symbol of my fate  
  
I can lead you down the path and back to life  
All I ask is that you worship me  
I can help you seek revenge and save yourself  
Give you life for all eternity  
  
Servants of the fallen, fight to pawe the way  
For the saviour's calling, on this wicked day  
To unveil the madness with a vicious pain  
One man rises up, standing in their way  
  
Redemption, redemption for humanity

Far too many voices

For all that we believe  
We fight till death or glory  
Fight to be set free

Time to step down and time to walk away  
You'll never rule me now  
Though you may stand upon my grave  
  
You can look the other way  
Or you can face the light  
Although it seems so far away  
Freedom's worth the fight

Locked in a kingdom of fear

Coping with this shit at such an age  
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage  
Family disease pumped through your blood  
Never had the chance you thought you could  
Running all the while with no escape  
Turning all that pain in to blame and hate  
Living on your own by twenty one  
Not a single care and having fun  
Consuming all the life in front of you  
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue  
  
Possessive obsessions,  
Selfish childish games.  
Vengeful resentments,  
Passing all the blame.  
  
Living out a life of decadence  
Acing without thought of consequence  
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast  
While spitting on the ones that matter most  
Running power mad with no control  
Fighting for the credit they once stole  
No one can ever tell you what to do  
Ruling other's lives while the can't stand the thought of you  
  
A living reflection,  
Seen from miles away.  
A hopeless affliction,  
Having run astray.  
  
I want to feel your body breaking,  
Want to feel your body breaking,  
And shaking,  
And left in the cold.  
I want to heal your conscience making  
A change to fix this dying soul.  
This Dying Soul.  
  
Now that you can see  
All you have done,  
It's time to take that step  
Into the kingdom.  
All your sins will  
Only make you strong,  
And help you break right  
Through the prison wall.  
  
Come to me my friend  
(Listen to me)  
I'll help this torture end  
(Help to set me free)  
Let your ego go  
(I can't carry this load)  
You can't go through this alone  
(I feel so hopeless and exposed)  
You'll find your peace of mind  
(Give me some direction)  
You can no longer hide  
(Break out of this isolation)  
Let humility  
(Openness, honesty)  
And become what you can be  
(A healing tranquility)  
  
Help me,  
Save me,  
Heal me,  
I can't break out of this prison all alone.  
  
These tormenting ghosts of yesterday,  
Will vanish when exposed.  
You can't hold onto your secrets,  
They'll only send you back alone.  
  
Your fearless admissions  
Will help expel your destructive obsessions.  
With my help I know you can  
Be at one with God and man.  
  
Hear me,  
Believe me,  
Take me,  
I'm ready to break right through this prison wall.

Dream Theater,Under A Glass Moon,/d/dream+theater/under+a+glass+moon_20043372.html,"Tell me  
Remind me  
Chase the water racing from the sky  
Always  
Beside me  
Taste the memories running from my eyes  
  
Nervous flashlights scan my dreams  
Liquid shadows silence their screams  
I smile at the moon  
Chasing water from the sky  
I argue with the clouds  
Stealing beauty from my eyes  
  
Outside the soundness of your mind  
Bathing your soul in silver tears  
Beneath a blackened summer sky  
Praying for time to disappear  
  
Beneath a summer sky  
Under glass moonlight  
Night awaits the lamb's arrival  
Liquid shadows crawl  
Silver teardrops fall  
The bride subsides to her survival  
  
By your hand  
I've awakened  
Bear this honor in my name  
  
Outside the soundness of your mind  
Bathing your soul in silver tears  
Beneath a blackened summer sky  
Praying for time to disappear  
  
Outside the soundness of your mind  
Bathing your soul in silver tears  
Beneath a blackened summer sky  
Praying for time to disappear

Dream Theater,Voices,/d/dream+theater/voices_20332272.html,"'Love, just don't stare'  
He used to say to me  
Every Sunday morning  
The spider in the window  
The angel in the pool  
The old man takes the poison  
Now the widow makes the rules  
  
'So speak, I'm right here'  
She used to say to me  
Not a word, not a word  
Judas on the ceiling  
The devil in my bed  
I guess Easter's never coming  
So I'll just wait inside my head  
  
Like a scream but sort of silent  
Living out my nightmares  
  
Voices repeating me  
'Feeling threatened?  
We reflect your hopes and fears.'  
Voices discussing me  
'Others steal your thoughts  
They're not confined  
Within your mind.'  
  
Thought disorder  
Dream control  
Now they read my mind on the radio  
But where was the Garden of Eden?  
  
I feel elated  
I feel depressed  
Sex is death, Death is sex  
Says it right here on my Crucifix  
  
Like a scream but sort of silent  
Living out my nightmares  
  
Voices protecting me  
'Good behavior  
Brings the Savior  
To his knees.'  
Voices rejecting me  
'Others steal your thoughts  
They're not confined  
To your own mind.'  
  
""I don't want to be here, 'cause of my  
Suffering, 'cause of my illness.  
Only love is worth having, only  
Love is what matters, loving every  
People on equal terms. ""  
""You've got to know who you're  
Dealin' with because, like a stranger,  
A-heh, just might come in through  
Here with a gun... and then, what  
Would you do? (Heh.)""  
""Everything is immaterial""  
""'n' you know that reality is immaterial.""  
""This is not reality""  
  
I'm kneeling on the floor  
Staring at the wall  
Like the spider in the window  
I wish that I could speak  
Is there fantasy in refuge?  
God in politicians?  
Should I turn on my religion?  
These demons in my head tell me to  
  
I'm lying here in bed  
Swear my skin is inside out  
Just another Sunday morning  
  
Seen my diary on the newsstand  
Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand  
It's a shame no one is praying  
'Cause these voices in my head  
Keep saying  
  
'Love, just don't stare.'  
'Reveal the Word when you're  
Supposed to'  
Withdrawn and introverted  
Infectiously perverted  
'Being laughed at and confused  
Keeps us pleasantly amused  
Enough to stay.'  
  
Maybe I'm just Cassandra fleeting  
Twentieth century Icon bleeding  
Willing to risk Salvation  
To escape from isolation  
  
I'm witness to redemption  
Heard you speak but never listened  
Can you rid me of my secrets?  
Deliver us from Darkness?  
  
Voices repeating me  
'Feeling threatened?  
We reflect your hopes and fears.'  
Voices discussing me  
Don't expect your own Messiah  
This never world which you desire  
Is only in your mind.

Showed the cowards  
Weren't there to mess around  
Heat exhaustion  
Mind distortion  
Military victory mounted on innocent ground  
Hearing voices from miles away  
Saying things never said  
Seeing shadows in the light of the day  
Waging a war inside my head  
War inside my head  
Years and years of  
Bloodshed and warfare  
Our mission was only to get in and kill  
A free vacation  
Of palm trees and shrapnel  
Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell  
Hearing voices from miles away  
Saying things never said  
Seeing shadows in the light of the day  
Waging a war inside my head  
Feeling strangers staring my way  
Reading minds never read  
Tasting danger with each word I say  
Waging a war inside my
