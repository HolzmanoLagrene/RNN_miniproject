Dusty Springfield,Sandra,/d/dusty+springfield/sandra_20044006.html,"She's a great little housewife  
Though sometimes she talks like a fool  
But she helps at the store in the holiday rush  
And she picks up the kids after school  
And she puts down the 'phone  
When her husband comes home  
And she changes from mother to wife  
'Til she feels the words hanging between them  
And she hangs by her words to her life  
  
She says  
I swear I love my husband  
I love my kids  
I wanted to be like my mother  
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did  
Oh, there might have been time to be me for myself, for myself  
So many things that she wishes  
She don't even know what she's missing  
And that's how she knows that she missed  
  
She's a sweetheart except when she's moody  
It's hard to get through to her then  
Depressed for a while when the youngest was born  
Ah, but that happens now and again  
Ah, she might take a drink with the housework  
Or when Michael's kept late at the shop  
A martini or two before dinner  
But she always knows when to stop  
  
She says  
I swear I love my husband  
And I love my kids  
And, though I wanted to be like my mother  
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did

Oh, they used to hold hands at the movies  
Now it's seldom, if ever, they go  
Once you pay for the sitter, and parking the car  
There's no money left for the show  
She was doing the dishes  
When a glass fell and broke on the tile  
And she cut her wrist, quite by mistake  
It was real touch and go for a while  
  
She says  
Oh God, I love my husband  
And I love my kids  
Well, I wanted to be like my mother

The devil prays on runaways  
He's never far behind  
The many years I've tried  
Now have been revealed to me  
Closer is the love you'll find  
Waiting so patiently  
God, will you lead me where I roam?  
Help me not to let my feelings show.  
No, no  
Take the devil  
Take the devil  
From your mind

Eagles,The Girl From Yesterday,/e/eagles/the+girl+from+yesterday_20044479.html,"It wasn't really sad the way they said goodbye  
Or maybe it just hurt so bad, she couldn't cry  
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away  
And she became the girl from yesterday  
  
He took a plane across the sea to some foreign land  
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand  
How someone who had been so close could be so far away  
And she became the girl from yesterday  
  
She doesn't know what's right, she doesn't know what's wrong  
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting so long  
And she doesn't count the teardrops that she's cried while he's away  
Because she knows deep in her heart that he'll be back someday  
  
The light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phone  
Talking to a memory that's never coming home  
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say  
But she'll always be the girl from yesterday  
Yeah, she'll always be the girl from yesterday

Eagles,Try And Love Again,/e/eagles/try+love+again_20044487.html,"When you're out there on your own  
Where your memories can find you  
Like a circle goes around  
You were lost until you found out  
What it all comes down to  
  
One by one  
The lonely feelings come  
Day by day, they slowly fade away  
  
Ooh, the look was in her eyes  
You never know what might be found there  
She was dancing right in time  
And the moves she made so fine  
Like the music that surrounds her  
  
Should I stay or go?  
I really want to know  
Would I loose or win  
If I try and love again?  
Oh oh oh gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh I'm gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh gonna try and love  
  
Right or wrong, what's done is done  
It's only moments that you borrow  
But the thoughts will linger on  
Of the lady and her song  
When the sun comes up tomorrow  
  
Well, it might take years  
To see through all these tears  
Don't let go  
When you find it you will know  
  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again  
Oh oh oh, gonna try and love again

Ed Sheeran,Make It Rain,/e/ed+sheeran/make+it+rain_21091360.html,"[Verse 1]  
When the sins of my father  
Weigh down in my soul  
And the pain of my mother  
Will not let me go  
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky  
To refine the purest of kings  
And even though I know this fire brings me pain  
Even so, and just the same  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Make it rain  
Make it rain down, lord  
Make it rain  
Oh, make it rain  
  
[Verse 2]  
Well, a seed needs the water  
Before it grows out of the ground  
But it just keeps on getting hard  
Hunger more profound  
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye  
But they may as well be in vain  
And even though I know these tears come with pain  
Even so, and just the same  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
[Verse 3]  
The seas are full of water  
Stops by the shore  
It's like the riches of grandeur  
Never reach the poor  
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause  
And let lightning be the veins  
And fill the sky with all that they can draw  
When it's time to make a change

Ed Sheeran,Nina,/e/ed+sheeran/nina_21085121.html,"I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well  
And I could play the guitar just like ringing a bell  
Sometimes I wonder  
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover  
To me listening to Stevie Wonder  
Under the covers where we used to lay  
And re-stacks is what the speakers play  
I'll be on tour almost every day  
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  
Just watching the dvd, smoking illegal weed  
Getting high as two kites, and we needed to breathe  
We used each other's air just for the people to see  
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep  
We go anywhere, our minds would take us  
And also you are beautiful without your make-up  
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause  
We can all be loved the way God made us  
And time's the only reason that we could break up  
Cause you would always tell me away too much  
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane  
Or make a mistake, say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
And every weekend in the winter  
You'd be wearing my hoodie  
With draw strings pulled tight  
To keep your face in the cold  
Taking day trips to the local  
Where we eat on the road  
Cause every day when I was away  
We'd only speak on the phone  
Watching Blue Planet  
Creating new habits  
And if we were two rabbits  
And then you vanish  
Back to 'burgh with all the Celtics, i'd dissapear  
You call me selfish, I understand  
But I can't help it  
I put my job before everything  
Except my family and friends  
But you'll be in between forever  
So I guess we'll have to take a step back  
Overlook the situation  
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications  
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break  
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late  
So we can either deal with the pain  
Or wait to get on a plane  
But in the day we'll have to say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Love will come and love will go  
But you can make it on your own  
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now  
People grow, and fall apart  
But you can mend your broken heart  
Take it back, oh won't you leave me now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
Then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both

Till it's a-fixed I'm a-usin' the stairs  
Hope they hurry up before it's too late  
Want my baby too much to wait  
All this climbin' is a-gettin' me down  
They'll find my corpse draped over a rail  
But I climbed one, two flight, three flight four

Eddie Cochran,Two Young Lovers,/e/eddie+cochran/two+young+lovers_20773899.html,"I saw two lovers walking along the sandy shore  
Her tiny hand was locked in his, two hearts beatin' a chord  
Two young lovers like you and I  
With young love that just won't die  
They stopped to pick a pebble, each one must make a wish  
They cast them out into the blue and sealed it with a kiss  
They stood beneath an elmtree, carved initials in a heart  
And pledged to undying love, which only death could part  
Two young lovers like you and I  
With young love that just won't die  
Just won't die, will not die, never die

Someone has been found on the rocks down in the bay.  
  
Did you see him hide? Did you see him crawl?

Before the bulldozers waltzed in and killed the old street

Lay shattered and wasted since our last goodbye
