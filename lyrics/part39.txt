That you would wait, wait for me eternally

your still the same, only you can say  
I'll be so glad to be back with you  
I'll do anything you want me to  
  
That's what I want, I'll be so happy, back home  
I see your light, shine in my window  
And I know I am coming home  
And as the light grows, grows ever brighter  
I see your face, you are alone  
And when I tell you all the things I have seen  
You'll say that darling you must have been dreaming  
  
That's what I want, I'll be so happy, back home  
Electric visions have crossed, strange decisions have crossed  
I felt the stars above me, I have someone to love me  
That's what I want, I'll be so happy, back home  
  
Believe me baby when I say, I wish I never, never,  
never, never, never be away  
For the things that I see, Be meant for the eyes of a time  
And when we walk alone together  
That's how I want it to be, want it to be forever  
  
That's what I want, I'll be so happy

Walking on a wave she came  
Staring as she called my name  
  
And I can't get it out of my head  
No, I can't get it out of my head  
Now my old world is gone for dead  
'Cause I can't get it out of my head  
  
Breakdown on the shoreline  
Can't move, it's an ebbtide  
Morning, don't get here tonight  
Searching for her silver light  
  
And I can't get it out of my head  
No, I can't get it out of my head

Robin Hood and William Tell  
And Ivanhoe and Lancelot  
They don't envy me  
Sitting 'til the sun goes down  
In dreams the world keeps going 'round and 'round  
  
And I can't get it out of my head  
No, I can't get it out of my head

I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides  
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching  
Picture slides

As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light  
Of the moon  
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums  
And I heard the police playin' with their guns  
But I never heard nothing like you  
In the country where the sky touches down  
On the field she lay her down to rest  
In the morning sun  
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to  
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't  
Give a damn

Is it a dream, when will it end  
When everything we've ever known  
Has ended and I'm all alone  
  
Where will I go, where will I be  
The feelings that I've never shown  
Maybe I'll find the answer when you're gone-

And the lord of life came following, his sins to be forgiven  
While the world sat back and laughed away the hours  
Till the dawning of the daybreak  
  
I heard them laugh I heard them cry  
I saw them praying to the sky  
I heard the wind howl in the trees  
Down there on bended knee  
And I see the light  
But I know I must be dreaming  
  
Feel the soul, quiet emotion  
Sail on by, helpless devotion  
If that's how it feels, it better be real  
  
Take care of your woman  
Or you'll never ever see the light  
Take heed of the warnin'  
Or you know it's gonna be too late  
  
Here, there, everywhere  
They keep on movin' without fear  
They look me up, they look me down  
They press my body to the ground  
But I see the light, see the light it's comin' shinin'  
  
And on a summers day  
When thoughts are drifting far away  
And life is good and real to see  
My world is saved and I am free  
But in the night  
Still I know I must be dreaming

About a nest... apart

I guess i always will

But only the wise understand  
That shining at night in Tunisia  
They guide you through the desert sand  
  
Words fail, to tell a tale  
Too exotic to be told  
Each night's a deeper night  
In a world, ages old  
  
The cares of the day seem to vanish  
The ending of day brings release  
Each wonderful night in Tunisia  
Where the nights are filled with peace  
  
Each wonderful night in Tunisia

Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,  
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.  
  
I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.  
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every day then see  
the doctor anyway.  
  
What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.  
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.  
  
I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow  
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,  
And that would never never do  
  
What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.  
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

Ella Fitzgerald,At Last,/e/ella+fitzgerald/at+last_20045677.html,"I wandered near and far  
I wished upon a star  
And darling here you are, at last  
My guardian angel must have sent you  
To find me  
  
Now I've left the heartaches, behind me  
Although the road was long  
I thought that i was strong  
And now the saddest song is passed  
  
In this big world, full of losers  
The beggars can't be choosers  
I wished on my star and here you are at last

Because you're married to me.  
  
Not like a ballroom  
A small room, a hall room  
Where I can smoke my pipe away  
With your wee head upon my knee.  
  
We will thrive on, keep alive on  
Just nothing but kisses  
With mister and missus  
On little blue chairs.  
  
You sew your trousseau  
And Robinson Crusoe  
Is not so far from worldly cares  
As our blue room far away upstairs!

They say there's moonbeams I should view  
But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When I met you the world was bright and sunny  
When you left the curtain fell  
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny  
Now my world's a faded pastel  
  
Well, I guess I'm luckier than some folks,  
I've known the thrill of loving you  
And that alone is more than I was created for  
Cause I was born to be blue

All by myself in the night  
I sit alone with a table and a chair  
So unhappy there  
Playing solitaire  
  
All by myself I get lonely  
Watching the clock on the shelf  
I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder  
I hate to grow older  
All by myself

Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face?  
Can't you see  
I'm longing to be in his place?  
Won't you change partners and dance with me?  
  
Ask him to sit this one out.  
While you're alone,  
I'll tell the waiter to tell  
Him he's wanted on the telephone.  
  
You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when.  
Won't you change partners and then,  
You may never want to change partners again.

Don't grow up, I beg of you

And touches with her hand the summer trees,  
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.  
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,  
  
A winding country lane all russet brown,  
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.  
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,  
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.  
  
I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view  
So early, early.  
Darling if you care, please, let me know,  
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.  
Let's never have to share another early autumn.

Ella Fitzgerald,Ev'rything I've Got,/e/ella+fitzgerald/evrything+ive+got_20045723.html,"Don't stamp your foot at me,  
It's impolite  
To stamp your foot at me  
Is not quite right.  
At man's ingratitude  
A woman winks,  
But such an attitude just stinks.  
  
I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks.  
I have words that do not come from children's books  
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist,  
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist.  
There are hammerlock holds,  
I've mastered a few,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
Share for share, share alike,  
You get struck each time I strike.  
You for me- me for me-  
I'll give you plenty of nothing.  
I'm not yours for better but for worse,  
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse.  
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two,  
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you.  
  
Don't raise your voice at me,  
That's very rude.  
To raise your voice at me  
Is rather crude.  
It's wrong essentially when woman yells,  
And confidentially, it smells.  
  
I'll converse with you on politics at length,  
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength.  
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put,  
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot.  
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
Off to bed we will creep,  
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep  
Till the birds start to peep.  
I'll give you plenty of nothing.  
I'll be yours forever and a day  
If the first good breeze does not blow me away.  
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
  
You may have some things that I can't use at all.  
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small.  
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
You won't know how good I am until you try  
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry.  
I've a marvelous way of telling you no,  
And everything I've got belongs to you.  
And everything you want belongs to me!  
And everything you need belongs to me!  
  
Life has no shape or form  
And no design.  
It isn't life without  
That fool of mine.  
I used to gad about  
With any chap  
And now I'm sad about my sap.  
  
He's a living thing that isn't quite alive,  
He has brains enough for any child of five.  
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim,  
But everything I've got belongs to him.  
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone.  
He has eyes for every skirt except my own.  
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb,  
But everything I've got belongs to him.  
Something beats in his chest,  
But it's just a pump at best.  
I'm for him, he's for him.  
He gives me plenty of nothing.  
When I see that funny face, I know  
Something scared his mother twenty years ago.  
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!  
Till everything he's got belongs to me!  
  
And everything I've got belongs to him!  
And everything I've got belongs to us!

But now you're doing wrong  
When you start to patter

And make it snappy!

I gotta right to feel low-down  
I gotta right to hang around  
Down around the river  
A certain gal in this old town  
Keeps draggin' my poor (old) heart around  
All I see, for me is - misery  
I gotta right to sing the blues  
I gotta right to moan and sigh  
I gotta right to sit and cry  
Down around the river  
I know the deep blue sea  
Will soon be callin' me  
It must be love - say what you choose  
I gotta right to sing the blues

Ella Fitzgerald,I Remember You,/e/ella+fitzgerald/i+remember+you_20045768.html,"Was it in Tahiti,were we on the Nile  
Long long ago say an hour ago  
I recall that I saw your smile  
I remember you-ooh  
You're the one who made my dreams come true  
A few kisses ago  
  
I remember you-ooh  
You're the one who said ""I love you, too""  
Yes, I do, didn't ya know?  
  
I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell  
Like the rain out of the blue  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of it all  
Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh  
  
I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell  
Just like the rain out of the blue  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of it all  
Then I will tell them I remember, tell them I remember  
Tell them I remember you

One would never guess what I must confess

You're my happiness  
  
Fate has started a story so blind  
You can make it the perfect rhyme

I'm getting sentimental over you

Won't you please be kind, and just make up your mind  
That you'll be sweet and gentle, be gentle with me  
Beause I'm sentimental over you

Not that I ever try to be a saint

I'm old fashioned  
I love the moonlight  
I love the old fashioned things  
  
The sound of rain  
Upon a window pane  
The starry song that April sings  
  
This year's fancies  
Are passing fancies  
But sighing sighs holding hands  
These my heart understands  
  
I know I'm old fashioned  
But I don't mind it  
That's how I want to be  
As long as you agree  
To stay old fashioned with me  
  
I'm old fashioned  
But I don't mind it

It makes a cloudy day sunny  
Makes a bee think of honey

Imagination is crazy  
Your whole perspective gets hazy  
Starts you asking a daisy  
What to do, what to do?  
  
Have you ever felt  
A gentle touch and then a kiss  
And then and then  
Find it's only your imagination again? Oh, well  
  
Imagination is silly  
You go around willy-nilly  
For example I go around wanting you  
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

And finally we step to leave to the departure lounge of disbelief.  
  
And I don't know where I'm going but I know it's gonna be a long time.  
And I'll be leaving in the morning come to the white wine bitter sunlight.  
  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight  
Before the bleeding sun comes alive  
I want to make the best of what is left hold tight  
And hear my beating heart one last time before daylight.  
  
And the canyon underneath the trees  
Behind the dark sky you looked at me.  
I fell for you like autumn leaves  
Never faded evergreen  
  
And I don't know where I'm going but I know it's gonna be a long time  
'Cause I'll be leaving in the morning come to the white wine bitter sunlight  
  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight  
Before the bleeding sun comes alive  
I want to make the best of what is left hold tight  
And hear my beating heart one last time.  
  
I can't face, now everything has changed  
I just wanna be by your side  
Here's hoping we collide  
Here's hoping we collide  
Here's hoping we collide  
  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight  
Before the bleeding sun comes alive  
I wanna make the best of what is left hold tight  
And hear my beating heart one last time  
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight.

Makes my heart beat like a drum

Hot and cold in a lonely hotel room  
Look into me, tell me why you're crying I need to know  
'Cause you always want what you're running from  
It's always been away

(Numa numa)  
(Numa numa)  
(Numa numa)  
(Numa numa)  
  
[Verse 1]  
You call me up  
(Numa numa)  
It's like a broken record  
(Numa numa)  
Saying that your heart hurts  
(Numa numa)  
That you never get over him getting over you  
(Numa numa)  
And you end up crying  
(Numa numa)  
And I end up lying  
(Numa numa)  
Cos I'm just a sucker for anything that you do  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And when the phone call finally ends  
You say, ""thanks for being a friend""  
(Numa numa)  
And we're going in circles again and again  
  
[Chorus]  
I dedicate this song to you  
The one who never sees the truth  
That I can take away your hurt, heartbreak girl  
Hold you tight, straight through the daylight  
Anyone can  
I'm right here when you gonna realize  
That I'm your cure, heartbreak girl?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I bite my tongue  
(Numa numa)  
But I want to scream out  
(Numa numa)  
You could be with me now  
(Numa numa)  
But I end up telling you what you want to hear  
(Numa numa)  
But you're not ready  
(Numa numa)  
And it's so frustrating  
(Numa numa)  
He treats you so bad and I'm so good to you, it's not fair  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And when the phone call finally ends  
You say, ""I'll call you tomorrow at 10,""  
(Numa numa)  
And I'm stuck in the friendzone again and again  
  
[Chorus]  
I dedicate this song to you  
The one who never sees the truth  
That I can take away your hurt, heartbreak girl  
Hold you tight, straight through the daylight  
Anyone can  
I'm right here when you gonna realize  
That I'm your cure, heartbreak girl?  
  
[Bridge]  
I know someday it's gonna happen  
And you'll finally forget the day you met him  
Sometimes you're so close to your confession  
I've gotta get it through your head  
That you belong with me instead anyone can  
  
[Chorus]  
I dedicate this song to you  
The one who never sees the truth  
That I can take away your hurt, heartbreak girl  
Hold you tight, straight through the daylight  
Anyone can  
I'm right here when you gonna realize  
That I'm your cure, heartbreak girl?

Ellie Goulding,O Holy Night,/e/ellie+goulding/o+holy+night_21105126.html,"[Verse 1]  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and ever pining  
Til He appeared and the spirit felt its worth  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
  
[Chorus]  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O the night when Christ was born  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
  
[Verse 2]  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains He shall break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
O the world, the star is sweetly gleaming  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
  
[Chorus]  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O the night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
  
[Outro]  
O the night when Christ was born  
When Christ was born  
When Christ was born

Never Too Soon,  
Oh, Reckless, Abandon.  
  
Like No One's Watching You  
No One.  
  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud,  
A kiss, a cry  
Our rights, our wrongs,  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud.  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud.  
  
So stay there,  
Because I'll be coming over.  
And while our blood's still young  
It's so young  
It runs  
And we won't stop until it's over.  
Won't stop to surrender.  
  
Songs of desperation  
I played them for you  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud,  
A kiss, a cry  
Our rights, our wrongs,  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud.  
A moment, a love  
A dream aloud.  
  
So stay there,  
Because I'll be coming over.  
And while our blood's still young  
It's so young

And we won't stop until it's over.  
Won't stop to surrender.

Ellie Goulding,The End,/e/ellie+goulding/the+end_20896388.html,"We've only ever kissed lying down  
We've only ever touched  
When there's no one else around  
I can be elusive  
If you want me to  
I'm not being intrusive  
I just wish I knew the truth  
  
As to why  
I wait for you  
Longer than the average person would  
And why  
I think about you  
More than I think one should  
  
Our bodies fit together  
Like a make-shift puzzle  
And it's clear to see why you puzzle me  
And you turn your frame  
And you whisper my name  
As though I am a burden  
  
Cause I'm making up for lost time  
And I'm making up for you  
And I'm waking up from last night  
And I'm waking up with you  
So what's new?  
So what's new?  
  
I am at your house  
So I belong to you for now  
Trying to impress you  
But lord I don't know how  
I can be a statue  
If you want me to  
I'm not being difficult  
I just need to know the truth  
  
As to why  
I'm wanting you  
And I would take you if I could  
And why I'm still (lay?) here  
It's something I still haven't understood  
  
Our hands rest together  
Like pieces of paper  
But they're always blank  
When I hold your hand  
And it gave you a fright  
When I stayed the night  
And you gave yourself to me  
  
Cause I'm making up for lost time  
And I'm making up for you  
And I'm waking up from last night  
And I'm waking up with you  
So what's new?  
So what's new?  
  
It's not the end  
It's not the end  
So don't lets pretend  
  
Cause I'm making up for lost time  
And I'm making up for you  
And I'm waking up from last night  
And I'm making up for you  
So what's new?  
So what's new?  
So what's new?

Some day my pain,  
Will mark you.  
  
Harness your blame,  
Harness your blame,  
And walk through.  
  
With the wild wolves around you,  
In the morning I'll call you  
Send it farther on.  
  
Solace my game,  
Solace my game  
It stars you.  
  
Swing wide your crane,  
Swing wide your crane  
And run me through.  
  
And the story's all over you  
In the morning I'll call you  
Can't you find a clue when  
Your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue.  
  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost

I wait for a word  
Lie next to your frame  
Girl unobserved  
You change your position  
And you are changing me  
Casting these shadows  
Where they shouldn't be  
  
We're interrupted by the heat of the sun  
Trying to prevent what's already begun  
You're just a body  
I can smell your skin  
And when I feel it, you're wearing thin  
  
But I've got a plan  
Why don't you be the artist,  
And make me out of clay?  
Why don't you be the writer  
And decide the words I say?  
'Cause I'd rather pretend  
I'll still be there at the end  
Only it's too hard to ask,  
Won't you try to help me  
  
Sat on your sofa, it's all broken springs  
This isn't the place for those violin strings  
I try out a smile and I aim it at you  
You must have missed it  
You always do  
  
But I've got a plan  
Why don't you be the artist,  
And make me out of clay?  
Why don't you be the writer  
And decide the words I say?  
'Cause I'd rather pretend  
I'll still be there at the end

Oh, who am I to say I'm always yours?  
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores?  
Oh, I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart  
We're falling on each other like we're always in the dark

Reaching higher than towers  
Wasn't anywhere we couldn't went  
We had unbreakable powers  
When our bodies meet, it's everything  
This is was a beautiful vision  
Even love was not a way you could describe it  
And then there comes a collision  
Nothing ever goes in the night  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
And they're not lost forever  
Lost what once was here  
It's now just spots  
Now the fireworks are fading  
Is it over?  
Lost you in the summer two years ago  
  
[Chorus]  
You, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
Two years ago  
You, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
Two years ago

If there's no storm, why're we a shipwreck?  
Thought our love is insurmountable  
He knows my heart is still aching  
Never thought it would be caused by you

Two years ago  
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong  
Two years ago  
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on  
Moving on, moving on, moving on  
  
[Bridge]  
And the reason I can't forget is I think you do too  
I know you think of me, too  
I'll use this moment to really forget  
I will soon, but for now  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you  
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you

About you, about you

About you, about you

Making us tiresome (and fearful)  
Can you get up right now  
Endeavor to free fall?  
  
You can fall if you want to!  
It's just a matter of how far  
You've treasured our hometown,  
But you've forgotten where you are  
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found,  
And it has been found wondering around  
  
With that skipping rope, the trampoline,  
The crafty smoke that made us choke  
But we didn't give up hope  
It's just the simple ways of getting paid,  
The carelessness of running away  
I wish I stayed  
I wish I stayed  
  
Patterns all arranged in my background  
Pillars and posts keeping this country on form  
Letters were all sent  
With no addresses so that people can't discover  
That we're always under cover  
Why do I always draw triangles?  
Instead of words this paper deserves  
  
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind,  
And it's not what you've lost but it's what you find

Easily hide  
  
I don't have much money

I'd buy a big house where  
We both could live.  
  
So excuse me forgetting  
But these things I do  
See I've forgotten if  
They're green or they're blue  
  
Anyway the thing is,  
What I really mean,  
Yours are the sweetest eyes  
I've ever seen  
  
And you can tell everybody  
This is your song  
It maybe quite simple but  
Now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind  
I hope you don't mind  
That I put down in words  
How wonderful life is  
Now you're in the world  
  
If I was a sculptor  
But then again no  
Or a girl who makes potions in  
A traveling show  
I know it's not much but  
It's the best I can do.  
My gift is my song and  
This one's for you.

Said I'm gonna keep this good luck piece  
Of iron inside my truck

And grabbed his old black dog  
As we piled on in and cut out through  
That late November fog  
  
Dull as a plowshare rusting in the yard  
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye  
While the auctioneers all played cards  
On every other Sunday  
I'd walk down to Moe's and back  
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show,  
For a dollar and a half  
  
Come on little sister get up offa my knee  
Gonna settle down someday  
In a town called Jubilee  
Come on brother Jake  
Break on out and a break free  
Gonna set things right and set up a house  
In a town called Jubilee  
  
That fog came out of nowhere  
Short of what I can tell  
Hand to hand we passed that bucket  
Up and down from the well  
Gone to California  
Used to be what folks would say  
Down around these parts if it was me  
I'd have hoped that west bound stage  
  
Come on little sister get up offa my knee  
Gonna settle down someday  
In a town called Jubilee  
Come on brother Jake  
Break on out and a break free  
Gonna set things right and set up a house  
In a town called Jubilee  
  
One less hallelujah  
A little less sympathy  
Lily and Jake, the old black dog  
A pinewood box, a rocking horse  
All gone to Jubilee  
  
Come on little sister get up offa my knee  
Gonna settle down someday  
In a town called Jubilee  
Come on brother Jake  
Break on out and a break free  
Gonna set things right and set up a house  
In a town called Jubilee

Elton John,A Word In Spanish,/e/elton+john/a+word+in+spanish_20046590.html,"I don't know why  
I just know I do  
I just can't explain  
In this language that I use  
Something leaves me speechless  
Each time that you approach  
Each time you glide right through me  
As if I was a ghost  
  
If I only could tell you  
If you only would listen  
I've got a line or two to use on you  
I've got a romance we could christen  
  
And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand  
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man  
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere  
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears  
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish  
  
If you can't comprehend  
Read it in my eyes  
If you don't understand it's love  
In a thin disguise  
And what it takes to move you  
Each time that you resist  
Is more than just a pretty face  
To prove that I exist  
  
When manners make no difference  
And my gifts all lay undone  
I trade my accent in on chance  
And fall back on a foreign tongue

Elton John,All Across The Havens,/e/elton+john/all+across+the+havens_20046533.html,"The sister of sunlight  
Comes to my lonely life  
Bearing the crosses I hung  
I hung on my lonely wife  
And the anchor told me  
If I prayed by the river  
That the sweet sound of water  
Would always go with her  
  
All across the havens to the waterfall  
They told me I would meet her there  
Inside those icy walls  
But how on earth in this universe  
Can they forgive me of my pains  
For all across the havens  
I must stumble locked in chains  
  
Then the mother of mercy  
Showed me her stable  
And told me you would be safe  
Safe in her cradle  
And the waterfall opened  
And the water withdrew  
Leaving me standing  
On a road leading through

Elton John,And The House Fell Down,/e/elton+john/and+the+house+fell+down_20538326.html,"The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down  
I'm more paranoid with every little sound  
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around  
And a siren wailing on the other side of town  
  
Oh the TVs on and the colors really hurt my head  
If I could think straight I'd wish that I was dead  
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed  
Instead I'm hanging over Hell suspended by a single thread  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I don't recall who said it at this time  
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind  
I built it up and the wolf he came around  
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down  
  
With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line  
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine  
And a little weed just to level me sometime  
I put the clock in the drawer 'cause I've cancelled out the time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So don't knock on my door, don't try to call  
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall  
When you're high as this you think you know it all  
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And still that saying gets inside my mind  
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind  
I built it up and the wolf he came around  
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

Lay my body on a feather bed  
And spoil me, Angeline, get to work  
When the whistle screams, Angeline  
Maybe someday, some way  
Somewhere in the future there's more pay  
Give me more cash, bring me sour mash  
Peel me a grape and fetch my stash  
And bite me, Angeline, let me use  
You like a sex machine, Angeline  
You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card  
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard  
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans  
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean, Angeline  
Well, I talk tough, I act rough  
Lay still honey, I can't get enough  
And keep your nose clean, let me be  
On your knees when you speak to me  
And trust me, Angeline and talk real dirty  
And I'll make you scream, Angeline  
You've got to swing that hammer and punch that card

Elton John,Answer In The Sky,/e/elton+john/answer+in+the+sky_10098650.html,"Well they say that it's a fact  
If you watch the sky at night  
And if you stare into the darkness  
You might see celestial light  
And if your heart is empty  
And there's no hope in sight  
There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
Well they say that it's a shame  
If you have nothing to believe  
And if you can't hold onto something  
You might as well die where you sleep  
You don't need a prayer  
And there's no price to ask why  
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
And it's all so much bigger than it seems  
And it all overwhelms us now and then  
And I'm banking on a chance we believe  
That good can still control the hearts of men  
  
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
And it's all so much bigger than it seems  
And it all overwhelms us now and then

This life's a long old road  
We shouldn't have to walk alone  
But if you find the right companion  
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown  
All life is precious  
And every day's a prize  
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky  
  
All life is precious

Elton John,Bad Side Of The Moon,/e/elton+john/bad+side+of+the+moon_20046710.html,"T seems as though I've lived my life  
On the bad side of the moon  
To stir your dregs in sickness still  
Without the rustic spoon  
  
Common people live with me  
Where the light has never shone  
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds  
To speak in a foreign tongue  
  
I'm a light world away  
From the people who make me stay  
Sitting on the bad side of the moon  
  
There ain't no need for watchdogs here  
To justify our ways  
We live our life in manacles  
The main cause of our stay  
  
Exiled here from other worlds  
My sentence comes too soon  
Why should I be made to pay  
On the bad side of the moon

And asked me for my name  
I stuttered out my answer  
And hung my head in shame  
  
Now they've found me  
At last they've found me  
It's hard to run  
From a starving family  
  
Now they've found me  
Well I won't run  
I'm tired of hearing  
There goes a well-known gun  
  
Now I've seen this chain gang  
Lord I say let me see my priest  
I couldn't have faced your desert sand  
Old burning brown backed beast  
  
The poor house they hit me for my kin  
And claimed my crumbling walls  
Now I know how Reno felt  
When he ran from the law

Screaming on the inside  
Give me your water, help me survive  
Gonna miss the sunlight  
When I lose my eyesight  
  
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance  
They search for an answer  
But that old man wouldn't listen  
Back then I was handsome  
Back then he was ignorant  
  
And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head  
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed  
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer  
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore  
  
Had garlands in the wings back then  
All the pretty little things back then  
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings  
After curtain calls and bows  
I can't see the front row now  
Hand me my red shoes just one more time  
  
They pushed aside our presence  
They refused to go the distance  
Back then I was Sigmund  
Back then he wouldn't listen

Elton John,Belfast,/e/elton+john/belfast_20046497.html,"Deep inside  
My soul fights a war  
I can't explain  
I can't cross over any more  
All I see are dirty faces  
Rain and wire  
And common sense in pieces  
But I try to see through Irish eyes, Belfast.  
  
Look outside  
Summer's lost and gone  
It's a long walk  
On a street of right and wrong  
In every inch of sadness  
Rock and tanks  
Go hand in hand with madness  
But I never saw a braver place, Belfast.  
  
And it's sad when they sing  
And hollow ears listen  
Of smokin' black roses  
On the streets of Belfast  
And so say your lovers  
From under the flowers  
Every foot of this world  
Needs an inch of Belfast  
  
Who's to say  
On whom Heaven smiles  
Our different ways  
We try harder to recognize  
No more enchanted evenings  
The pubs are closed  
And all the ghosts are leaving  
But you'll never let them shut you down,  
Belfast.  
  
And it's sad when they sing  
And hollow ears listen  
Of smokin' black roses  
On the streets of Belfast  
And so say your lovers  
From under the flowers  
Every foot of this world  
Needs an inch of Belfast  
  
The enemy is not at home  
A jealous green  
Streaks down this faulty diamond  
No bloody boots or crucifix  
Can ever hope to split this emerald island  
But I never saw a braver place,  
Belfast.

Elton John,Believe,/e/elton+john/believe_20046498.html,"I believe in love, it's all we got  
Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch  
War makes money, cancer sleeps  
Curled up in my father and that means something to me  
Churches and dictators, politics and papers  
Everything crumbles sooner or later  
But love, I believe in love  
  
I believe in love, it's all we got  
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross  
Love is simple, hate breeds  
Those who think difference is the child of disease  
Father and son make love and guns  
Families together kill someone  
Without love, I believe in love  
  
Without love I wouldn't believe  
In anything that lives and breathes  
Without love I'd have no anger  
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here  
Without love I wouldn't believe  
I couldn't believe in you  
And I wouldn't believe in me  
Without love  
  
I believe in love  
I believe in love  
I believe in love

Elton John,Better Off Dead,/e/elton+john/better+off+dead_20046200.html,"There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on  
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning  
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light  
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight  
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse  
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news  
  
Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches  
They always could find us but they never could catch us  
Through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe  
We watched the arrested get taken away  
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat  
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street  
  
Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire  
If you ask how I am, then I'll just say inspired  
If the thorn of a rose, is the thorn in your side  
Then you're better off dead, if you haven't yet died

Who seems to be so close to you instead  
Close to you instead  
  
I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad  
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad  
I guess I cannot have everything  
So much has flown between the years  
When I was twenty and you were seventeen  
  
So out of choice I chose rock and roll  
But it pushed me to the limit everyday  
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home  
From there on, there seemed no use for you  
For you to stay  
  
And if I shower around 3 a.m.  
It's just to wash away  
The trace of a love unwanted  
Oh in the times I went astray  
The times I went astray  
  
So much has flown between the years  
When I was twenty and you were seventeen

Elton John,Big Dipper,/e/elton+john/big+dipper_20046160.html,"Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor

And he just couldn't handle any more  
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper  
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours  
  
So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him  
And you took him down to the fairground after some action  
And by around about a quarter to six  
You found a different way to get your kicks  
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks  
Big dipper  
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks  
  
He hadn't been too keen at the start  
Now he seems to have a change of heart  
He's got his own big dipper  
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper  
He's got his own big dipper  
But there's always room for more  
  
Everybody's got a song to sing  
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper  
  
And at around about a quarter to ten  
You got up and did it all again  
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for  
Big dipper  
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours  
  
Another ride, another tune  
Another crazy afternoon  
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper

So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus

And I can't forget that trip to the west  
Singing blues for baby and me

It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky  
I called you my child, said honey now this is our game

In my younger days  
I built a wall all around my heart  
To keep the pain away  
I built it tall, and I built it wide  
I left no room for doubt  
Your love still found its way inside  
And couldn't get back out  
  
I'm breaking down the barriers  
Making up my mind  
I'm breaking down the barriers of time  
I'm taking down the barriers  
And loving what I find  
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie  
Between your love and mine  
  
I guess you know you were not the first  
You may not be the last  
But you have shown me a better way  
And now I'm learning fast  
You gotta go where the feeling flows  
I take it while it's hot  
You gotta give if you want to get  
And I want all you got

Elton John,Breaking Hearts,/e/elton+john/breaking+hearts_10097329.html,"Music by elton john  
Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Available on the album breaking hearts  
  
They used to say that boys are tough as nails  
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail  
Now things have changed, I feel so old  
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals  
  
I was always there in the thick of things  
I always had the heart of every woman on a string  
The danger zone shone from my eyes  
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile  
  
It's not the night reaching in and touching me  
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me  
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
  
It's not the light shining in and catching me  
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
But time has come and cast a spell on me  
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
  
And now I know what lonely means  
I used to give so little and gain everything  
The darkest part of every day  
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away  
  
Can't say I blame them all for being hurt  
After all I treated each and every one like dirt  
Who wants a heart that's never home  
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone

Did he say he'd come to call on me  
For things are getting desperate in our home  
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know  
  
Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside  
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide  
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps  
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep  
  
Burn down the mission  
If we're gonna stay alive  
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven  
See the red flame light the sky  
  
Burn down the mission  
Burn it down to stay alive  
It's our only chance of living  
Take all you need to live inside  
  
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today  
My wife cried when they came to take me away  
But what more could I do just to keep her warm  
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls

Such cruel sport for your kicks  
Such hard knocks on my heart  
How long before the pain ends?  
Tell me where living starts  
  
And lovers leap off burning buildings  
Waking up on a sky high wire  
Desperation leaves us clinging  
On the edge of a house on fire  
  
Lovers leap off burning buildings  
Live our life on borrowed time  
Every flame that ever moved you  
Touched your lips but never mine  
  
Lovers leap off burning buildings  
No room for conversation  
Cold stares and angry words  
Fall in pieces from our faces  
We read ""Do not disturb""  
  
Some lovers just go hungry  
Others beg for just a bite  
You use me under pressure  
To whet your appetite

Elton John,Cage The Songbird,/e/elton+john/cage+the+songbird_20046174.html,"Sober in the morning light  
Things look so much different  
To how they looked last night  
A pale face pressed to an unmade bed  
Like flags of many nations flying high above her head  
  
The cellophane still on the flowers  
The telegram still in her hand  
As whispers circulate all day  
Their back-stage baby princess passed away  
  
And you can cage the songbird  
But you can't make her sing  
And you can trap the free bird  
But you'll have to clip her wings  
Cause she'll soar like a hawk when she flies  
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies  
  
Promises of no more lies  
Fell flat upon an empty stage  
Before the audience arrived  
A return in time to the cheaper seats  
She never knew what lay beneath  
Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets  
  
Let down before the final curtain  
A shallow heart that left her cold  
She left in rouge upon the mirror  
A circled kiss to the faithful who'd miss her

Elton John,Calling It Christmas (With Joss Stone),/e/elton+john/calling+it+christmas+with+joss+stone_20825555.html,"On a hill long ago, on a cold winter's night  
In a land far away, three kings saw a light  
And from heaven it shone like God's, God's own crown  
And it guided three kings into Bethlehem town  
  
Oh, they came bearing gifts and so said each one  
Let's call this day Christmas from this moment on  
We'll be calling it Christmas in honor of him  
The child in the manger or savior and king  
  
We've been calling it Christmas, keeping the faith  
Knowing the reason we're saving the day  
We've been calling it Christmas down through the years  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here  
  
Oh, a simple belief was the start of it all  
A small child asleep on a bed made of straw  
[Unverified] where shepherds and kings  
First [Unverified] this moment would bring  
  
We've been calling it Christmas, keeping the faith  
Knowing the reason we're saving the day  
We've been calling it Christmas down through the years  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here  
  
We've been calling it Christmas, keeping the faith  
Knowing the reason we're saving the day  
We've been calling it Christmas down through the years  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here  
  
We've been calling it Christmas down through the years  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here

Elton John,Candlelit Bedroom,/e/elton+john/candlelit+bedroom_21081884.html,"The sound of one heart breaking, the sound of someone waking  
To the cold hard truth before the sun goes down  
If I could ever catch you a little bit of that  
I'd wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground  
  
On the ledge with one last chance to beg  
To the deepest root of the oldest tree  
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain  
Wrung out from the history in it's ancient leaves  
  
[Chorus:]  
All we need is a candlelit bedroom  
All you ever wanted was a state of grace  
Every waking moment you believe that  
Love will always lead you to a better place  
  
The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils  
The treasure and the lesson to be learned  
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this  
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn  
  
[Chorus (x2)]  
  
Love will always lead to a candlelit bedroom  
Only if you want it bad enough  
Every waking moment you believe that  
You must have a little faith in the light of love  
Every waking moment you believe that  
You must have a little faith in the light of love

Elton John,Can't Stay Alone Tonight,/e/elton+john/cant+stay+alone+tonight_21065973.html,"I blew the dust out of the corners  
Threw some dead wood on the fire  
Tuned the radio to silence  
Watched the evening sun expire  
  
Should have called you up this morning  
But I'm such a fool at times  
I still search my shaving mirror  
Looking for your face with mine  
  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Can't let another day go by  
Why is it always this way?  
Time never seems to really fly  
And time is never really on my side  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I can't stay alone tonight  
  
Chalk up one more crazy notion  
Imagination running wild  
But if I needed confirmation  
I would have gone that extra mile  
  
You're the last chance on the highway  
I'm that open stretch of road  
You're the diner in my rear-view  
A cup of coffee getting cold  
  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Can't let another day go by  
Why is it always this way?  
Time never seems to really fly  
And time is never really on my side  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I can't stay alone tonight  
  
Bruised in this cold war of words  
We've come undone two loose ends alone  
Possessed by that curse you've endured  
The spell that I cast couldn't make you come home  
  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Can't let another day go by  
Why is it always this way?  
Time never seems to really fly  
And time is never really on my side  
And I can't stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I can't stay alone tonight  
Things have to change and they might  
But I can't stay alone tonight

Elton John,Chameleon,/e/elton+john/chameleon_20046483.html,"The last I heard of you  
You were somewhere on a cruise in the Mediterranean  
So imagine my surprise to see you very much alive  
In the English rain again  
  
And I can still recall wet afternoons  
When we were small and simply childish  
But you've created your own ghost  
And the need you have is more than most to hide it  
  
Oh, Chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes  
Beyond a shadow of a doubt  
You're a devil, you're a devil in disguise  
Do you really change me, or am I going crazy  
Chameleon, Chameleon, Chameleon, you're free again my child  
  
I remember still those lazy summer days  
We'd kill out hunting danger  
And we were alien to all outsiders  
We had no desire to talk to strangers

Because we're going to the chapel  
And we're gonna to get married  
Going to the chapel  
And we're gonna get married  
Gee i really love you  
And we're gonna get married  
Going to the chapel of love  
  
Bells will ring, the sun will shine  
I will be hers, and she'll be mine  
We'll love until the end of time  
And we'll never be lonely any more

Elton John,Chasing The Crown,/e/elton+john/chasing+the+crown_20046151.html,"I built a wall in China, I sank an ocean liner  
I've wrecked homes, I've burned thrones, chasing the crown  
I've put thorns in your feet, I spread plague in the streets  
I've sprung traps, confused maps, chasing the crown  
  
I'm chasing the crown till he bites the apple  
I was licking my lips till his Son come down  
I'm chasing the crown, the crown, I'm chasing the crown  
I'm taking a turn in the right direction  
By leaving his soul in the lost and found  
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown  
  
I saw the tea float in Boston, I saw the live wire shock them  
I made them float, I made them drown, chasing the crown  
I laid the desert sands, I froze the polar caps  
Well, they'd dry out, and I'd shout ""Hey I'm chasing the crown""

When I tell you all my lies  
And pretending to believe them  
See through all my alibis  
And I need you more than ever  
And I want you till the end... Chloe  
  
How you handle what you live through  
I can never hope to learn  
Taking all the pain I give you  
Loving blindly in return  
And I need you more than ever  
I will always be your friend  
Chloe, Chloe

Chloe, what you gonna do about me  
Chloe, what you gonna do  
What you gonna do about me  
  
You're the lifeline that I cling to  
When I feel like giving in  
When the dreams that I rely on  
Start to wear a little thin  
Then I need you more than ever  
And I want you till the end

Elton John,Circle Of Life,/e/elton+john/circle+of+life_20046739.html,"From the day we arrive on the planet  
And blinking, step into the Sun  
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen  
More to do than can ever be done  
  
Some say eat or be eaten  
Some say live and let live  
But all are agreed as they join the stampede  
You should never take more than you give  
  
[Chorus]  
In the circle of life  
It's the wheel of fortune  
It's the leap of faith  
It's the band of hope  
Till we find our place  
On the path unwinding  
In the circle, the circle of life  
  
Some of us fall by the wayside  
And some of us soar to the stars  
And some of us sail through our troubles  
And some have to live with the scars  
  
There's far too much to take in here  
More to find than can ever be found  
But the Sun rolling high through the sapphire sky  
Keeps great and small on the endless round  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
On the path unwinding  
In the circle, the circle of life

And the light of the moon is banned  
And the stars up above  
Walk the heavens hand in hand  
There's a shady place  
At the end of the working day  
Where young lovers go  
And this hot little trio plays  
  
That's where we meet  
That's where we meet  
Me and you rendezvous  
In the club at the end of the street  
Oh, where we meet  
Oh, where we meet  
Me and you rendezvous  
In the club at the end of the street  
  
From the alleyways  
Where the catwalks gently sway  
You hear the sound of Otis  
And the voice of Marvin Gaye  
In this smoky room  
There's a jukebox, plays all night  
And we can dance real close  
Beneath the pulse of a neon light  
  
There's a downtown smell of cooking  
From the flame on an open grill  
There's a sax and a big bass pumping  
Lord, have mercy  
You can't sit still  
You can't sit still

Elton John,Cold Highway,/e/elton+john/cold+highway_20046536.html,"Your life stepped lightly out our hands  
When no one's looking out you understand  
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn  
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned  
  
And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down  
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground  
Oh your black icy snare once cut down my friend  
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end  
  
Every new version of the way of life  
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night  
But whose kid are you when they finally decide  
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died  
  
But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell  
The difference for you between heaven and hell  
To glorify something, your legends are found  
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground  
  
Years rolling by just like a dream  
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine  
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone  
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone

And I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left  
While a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune  
A mantle of bright light shone down from a room  
  
Come down in time I still hear her say  
So clear in my ear like it was today  
Come down in time was the message she gave  
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way  
  
Well I don't know if I should have heard her as yet  
But a true love like hers is a hard love to get  
And I've walked most all the way and I ain't heard her call  
And I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all  
  
Come down in time I still hear her say  
So clear in my ear like it was today  
Come down in time was the message she gave  
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way  
  
There are women and women, and some hold you tight  
While some leave you counting the stars in the night.

Just about a mile from Texarkana  
In them old cottonfields back home  
Let me tell you now well I got me in a mess  
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickety splits  
I had to walk a long long way to town  
Came along a nice old man  
Well he had a hammer  
Wait a minute mister, can you get me some direction  
I'm gonna wanna be right off for home  
Oh, let them cotton balls get rotten  
I got you baby, who needs cotton

Well, it sure feels good to breathe the air back home  
You should have seen their faces when they seen how I'd grown  
In them old cotton fields back home

We were having fun  
Wasn't long before I could not ignore  
She's about hanging out  
  
Campus queen dreams  
Shattered years ago  
And I'm the one who knows  
  
It's the same country love song  
Different words, a different melody  
It's the same country love song  
  
Mama said to me, ""John, you got to be  
Honest to yourself  
Keeping up the pace, losing in the race  
Further on the shelf""  
  
I want to write a country love song  
Tell them nothing's wrong

See'est la vie, mon cherie

She can swing us both forever  
In the long run she's the one who must decide  
  
And if she leaves me handle her with care  
Don't hurt little Crystal  
And if she calls you long distance just be there  
Oh Crystal  
The world is your oyster, you're a pearl  
But he's a jewel and my friend  
I'm sure that in the end, Crystal you'll be his little girl  
Oh Crystal  
  
You're stronger than me but I'm sure  
That the fight would fall to no one  
The cold hard truth is stronger than us all  
And it breaks my heart to see us go this far  
We're just captives in our separate cells  
And without her there's no peace behind these bars
