Lying beside you, here in the dark  
Feeling your heart beat with mind  
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere  
How could our live be so blind  
We sailed on together  
We drifted apart  
And here you are by my side  
  
Chorus:  
  
So now I come to you, with open arms  
Nothing to hide, believe what I say  
So here I am with open arms  
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me  
Open arms  
  
Ii.  
  
Living without you, living alone  
This empty house seems so cold  
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near  
How much I wanted you home  
  
But now that you've come back  
Turned night into day  
I need you to stay.  
  
(Repeat Chorus)

Trying to forget  
All the cruel words you said  
All the radio was playing

Clothes that I own  
And take it to the streets

On every single woman I see

Notch me on your gun

Don't call me on the phone  
Don't knock on my door

Somewhere in a motel...... Out in Oklahoma  
There's the Alabama dreamer  
That same man from Tennessee  
  
Sometime late at night...... The lonely wakes her gently  
And knocks at her door...... But she won't give in  
But like every other woman........ She needs to feel wanted  
She thinks of making love....... And goes to sleep again  
  
Carolina......... Dreamin' lonely  
Carolina......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady.....  
That I dream of holding tight.....  
That I kiss and tell goodnight.....

Sometime that next day..... On a Mississippi freeway  
The Alabama dreamer........ Is homeward bound  
His conscious is as clear........ As those green eyes of Carolina  
And she's waiting with the baby from the love.............. Of the only man to  
Lay her down

Carolina.......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady  
That I dream of holding tight  
That I kiss and tell goodnight

I don't care about the weather just whether I spend Christmas in your arms

We could drive up to the mountains, build a fire and watch it snow  
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow  
I'd be happy in the city, I'd be happy on the farm  
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms  
  
It was only last December I had no Christmas spirit in my heart  
My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart  
But now you're here beside me, no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree  
And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me

There I stood in another line  
Tryin to buy that last gift or two  
Not really in the Christmas mood  
  
Standin right in front of me  
Was a little boy waiting anxiously  
Pacing round like little boys do  
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes  
  
And his clothes were worn and old  
He was dirty from head to toe  
And when it came his time to pay  
I couldn't believe what I heard him say  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see, shes been sick for quite a while  
And I, know these shoes will make her smile  
And I, want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
He counted pennies for what seemed like years  
And the, cashier said Son, theres not enough here.  
He searched his pockets franticly  
Then he turned and he looked at me  
He said Mama made Christmas good at our house  
Most years she just did without  
Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do  
Somehow I've gotta buy her these Christmas shoes  
  
So I laid the money down  
I just had to help him out  
And Ill never forget the look on his face  
When he said Mamas gonna look so great

As he thanked me and ran out  
I knew that god had sent that little boy to remind me

The only fish you'll get down town ain't caught with a hook and sinker  
Put on your brakes, beep beep, honk your horn look out now turn on your
blinker  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I can stretch out right  
Give me the country side  
(Give me the country side)  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
I was born in Georgia town with a lack-a-daisy street  
A laid back lover just a-playin' games and a-stayin' off of them feet  
Nobody trying to get on your nerves, nobody tryin' to get what you've got  
And just live and let live by the golden rule now don't it just hit the spot  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I can stretch out right  
Give me the country side  
(Give me the country side)  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
Give me that country side of life

Well the magic attic's where the music rolls  
And the army-navy's got ol' jackie soul  
Down on peaches corner there are good ol' boys  
And mother fletchers makin' lots of noise  
They're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Well the tams are playin' at the port-o-call  
And the drifters underneath the boardwalk  
At the sapnish galleon and ol' fat jacks  
Jukebox playin' and the place is packed  
You bet they're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
You know they're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Got the top down and the traffic's slow  
Sun fun week and, we all go  
Where the girls are sunnin' and lookin' good  
Well i never met 'em but i wish i could  
And we'd go dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
We'd go dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Well the embers singin' up on ocean drive  
And the castaways are gettin' loud tonight  
At the electric circus they all getin' down  
And the carousel's spinnin' round and 'round  
See them dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
I see 'em dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Well i'm hangin out down at sloppy joes  
They may doze but they never close  
And the bama boys at the bowery  
They can't dance but they play for free  
But they like dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
They know dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
They wrote dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Shaggin' on the boulevard

Small town heaven and a big-eyed boy  
Made sweet music for a while  
My daddy worked hard down at the factory  
Nights he went to G.I. school  
He didn't know nothin' 'bout the silver spoon  
But he lived by the golden rule  
  
Summer nights he was gone me and mama stayed home  
Out on the front porch swing  
Wishin' on the stars in the southern sky  
And sometimes we used to sing  
  
We were leaning, leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin' all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of  
  
Got my real education from the T.V. station  
And good ole boys down at the park  
The say ""Hey, Willie"" and those rock-a-billies  
Made their way into my heart  
  
I remember the old folks sittin' 'round talkin'  
On laidback Sunday afternoons  
They said them young folks sure got a hard road  
Oh, they're growin' up too soon  
  
Now I know they were right, and as I sit here tonight  
Out on the front porch swing  
The stars are shinin' in my young boy's eyes  
Just like they did for me  
  
We are leaning, leaning on

I've seen a lot of love in my time  
Felt that physical attraction,  
From the touch in the heat of the night  
Been all over the country,  
Started my share of new flames  
But after all is said and done,  
there's only one that remains  
  
[Chorus]  
Dixie fire burning down in my soul  
Dixie fire it never leaves me whole  
It took a hometown girl to show me  
How cruel these hot summer nights can be  
Now there's a Dixie fire burning in the heart of me  
Burning in the heart of me  
  
Searching for some kind of direction,  
Looking for a guiding light  
Needed to see a lighthouse,  
Like a ship on a stormy night  
Somehow you heard my music,  
You felt the sadness in me  
You took the words that were so cold,  
And added a warm melody  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Burn, burn, burning  
Burn, burn, burning (Cant you see that Im)  
Burn, burn, burning (There's a Dixie fire)  
Burn, burn, burning (Don't you know that Im)

Stole her heart many years ago  
He promised her, he'd come back and take her  
Around the world, bring her hills of gold  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key

She runs to meet them down at the pier  
She sees the fishermen, the nets and the sunset  
But she don't see him, her eyes fill with tears  
She stands there lookin' at the crystal blue water  
And in the coral she imagines pearls  
She makes believe, he brought them all the way from China  
Then the water swirls, the blue-green water swirls

Alabama,God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You,/a/alabama/god+must+have+spent+a+little+more+time+on+you_20005152.html,"Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?  
  
How can I put into words what I feel?  
My life was complete, I thought I was whole  
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?  
Never knew that love could feel like this,  
And you changed my world with just one kiss.  
How can it be that right here with me there's an angel?  
It's a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
In all of creation, all things great and small  
You are the one that surpasses them all  
More precious than any diamond or pearl  
They broke the mold when you came in this world  
And I'm trying hard to figure out just how I ever did without  
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child  
That's deep inside, leaves me purified  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
Never thought that love could feel like this  
Then you change my world with just one kiss  
How can it be that right here with me  
There's an angel, is just a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
God must have spent a little more time on you

Gonna have a party. Come on along with me.  
Gonna have a good time, ev'rybody's feelin' right.  
Gonna have a party a week from Saturday night.  
  
Well, thought I'd call you early,  
I thought you'd like to know there's gonna be a party, and I'd love for you to

I just want to give you time to get your story right.  
There's gonna be a party, babe, and it might last all night.

Goodbye, goodbye  
Till I see you again  
Goodbye, goodbye  
I'll love and i'll miss you till then

Get in touch if the wind blows in your face  
I guess it's been too much fun  
We've shared and we've won  
Yes the best is yet to come  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
That one word hurts so bad  
You leave the best you've had  
But you keep the faith and pray to return  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
I'll love and i'll miss you till then  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye

I've listened to nothing that life had to tell me,  
Watched all my dreams rise and fall.

The first song I ever sang was haggard  
Momma sang to me I saw the Light  
I'd turn my radio up louder  
To hear Johnny Cash walk the line  
  
Waylon sang a song about Texas  
Willie's ""Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain""  
Bocephus sings a song about dixie.  
Lefty taught us all how to sing.

And to Tucker boys showed us how to jam.

Alabama,High Cotton,/a/alabama/high+cotton_20005155.html,"We didn't know the times were lean,  
Round our house the grass was green,  
It didn't seem like things were all that bad,  
  
I bet we walked a thousand miles,  
Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,  
And learnin' how to give it all we had.  
  
As Life went on and years went by,  
I saw the light in daddy's eye,  
And felt the love in mamma's hands,  
They kept us warm and kept us fed,  
Taught us how to look ahead,  
Now lookin' back I understand.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
When Sunday mornings rolled around,  
We dressed up hand-me-downs,  
Just in time to gather with the church,  
Some times I think how long It's been,  
And how it impressed me then,  
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,

She found her stage on a hardwood barroom floor  
But it's not the bottom, just part of a long, hard fall  
Her biggest fan's the man. Tonight she'll give her all

The mornin' papers told it in black and white, calling it another Hollywood

Alabama,If You're Gonna Play In Texas,/a/alabama/if+youre+gonna+play+in+texas_10003992.html,"If you're gonna play in texas,  
You gotta have a fiddle in the band.  
That lead guitar is hot,  
But not for ""lousiana man"".  
So rosin up that bow for ""faded love""  
And let's all dance.  
If you're gonna play in texas,  
You gotta have a fiddle in the band.  
  
I remember down in houston  
We were puttin' on a show  
When a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled,  
""cotton-eyed joe""!  
He said, ""we love what you're doin'.  
Boys don't get us wrong,  
There's just somethin' missin' in your song.  
  
Chorus  
  
So we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight.  
Them texans raised the roof when jeff opened up his case.  
You say y'all all wanna two-step. You say ya wanna doe-si-doe.  
Well, here's a fiddlin' song before we go.

And as I sit and play it now  
The songs all seem so sad somehow

And she's like a baby, just learning how to play  
  
She never thought that love could ever end so soon  
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon  
When he asked her to marry and she glady said O.K  
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday  
  
Now she's a lady down on love  
She needs somebody to gently pick her up  
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound  
To a man who would love her and never let her down

'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch  
But work took me a way from home late at nights  
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights  
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust  
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust  
  
Now she's a lady down on love  
She needs somebody to gently pick her up  
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound  
To man who would love her and never let her down

There's a little bitty hole in the ceiling above  
Sometimes the rain drips down on our temple of love  
We have to put a pot smack dab in the middle of the bed  
Somebody hit my car at the diner last night  
Had to drive it home with one taillight  
When I went out this morning, the engine was dead  
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage  
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age  
Small stuff  
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us  
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust  
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
There's a little cafe' on the corner of town  
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down  
And she don't sweat the small stuff

Alabama,Tar Top,/a/alabama/tar+top_20328538.html,"It was July hot 'cross Georgia on my way to myrtle beach  
I just got my diploma so I set out in search of me  
The honeymoon was over and Alabama was far away  
From being little more than just a southern state  
  
I got a gig down at the Bowery  
I played for tip and watered drinks  
Just a novice in a business  
That's seldom what it seems  
  
And where are you goin' tar top  
Where's J.C. and the chosen few?  
I saw the flash without T.Gentry  
And B.V. left for Malibu  
  
I was July, hot and thirty, some years down the line  
When the boys touched the nation, unaware at the time  
I got to go to Texas, California, New York too  
A farm boy who is thankful to be standin' in his shoes  
  
But in the Bowery hangs the memories  
Of dreams that still come true  
Every time I see the spotlights  
I'm one of the chosen few  
  
And where are you going tar top  
J.C. and the chosen few  
There's no flash without T.Gentry  
B.V. where are you?  
  
Where are you goin' tar top  
Which direction will you take  
What's this contraband clamor  
About the music that you make?  
  
And where are you goin' tar top  
Is it country enough?  
Is it contemporary glamor?  
No it's us, just us

Of stars that dance in the light  
And music far away  
  
They say that love is but a dance  
Don't let the music fade away  
Don't let the moment pass  
  
Without reason or rhyme  
The sweet bouquet of the wine  
Will vanish in the air  
  
The innocence of the rose  
She leaves where she goes  
For all the world to share  
  
Some days when clouds are drifting by  
I open my eyes and watch them go  
And wonder where they fly  
  
Some nights orion runs too fast  
I look to the stars as if to say  
Don't let the moment pass  
  
But soon a golden age is past  
Just when it seemed that miracles  
Where not too much to ask  
  
And though the world may turn too fast  
If it should seem like paradise  
Don't let the moment pass

Wish I wasn't hurt by all the things they say  
If I didn't need to know the simple truth about me  
Wouldn't it be easier to walk away  
  
And I don't need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, using your name  
Somebody out there, you get the blame  
There's doubt and suspicion  
It's hard to explain somebody out there  
  
And I don't need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, stolen your base  
Somebody out there, parked in your space  
You've no reservation, he's taken your place  
Somebody out there, wasting your time  
Somebody out there, using your dime  
Your friends think you're crazy  
They're way out of line  
Somebody out there, says that he's you  
Somebody out there, thinks like you do  
You stare at the mirror  
You're looking into  
Somebody out there

Ask yourself a question now there's a multiple choice  
""You've only one shot, get it right"", says a distance voice  
Don't get your head into a spin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
The enemy is closing in see the white of his eye  
He's taking in his prey in sight it's just a matter of time  
May the games begin the best man win  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know there is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run  
  
Count the bottles one by one as they fall to the ground  
Search your mind your heart your soul until the answer is found  
But watch your step the ice is thin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
The man in black looks down on you the insignificant one  
To be or not if all so true the deal is almost done  
It matters not you're lost to him  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show?  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself

To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you  
  
All that I ask you  
Is, show me how to follow you and I'll obey  
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way  
Let me see the light, let me be the light

Till the shadow of night is high

(I) Prelude  
  
""Shadows of shadows passing. It is now 1831, and as always I am  
absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite  
sensations, to which end music is inessential. Since the comprehension  
of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception, music, when combined  
with a pleasurable idea, is poetry. Music without the idea is simply music.  
Without music or an intriguing idea, colour becomes pallor, man becomes  
carcase, home becomes catacomb, and the dead are but for a moment  
motionless.""

I heard a tapping at my door  
I looked but nothing lay in the darkness  
And so I turned inside once more  
To my amazement  
There stood a raven  
Whose shadow hung above my door  
Then through the silence  
It spoke that one word  
That I shall hear forever more  
Nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven, nevermore  
And still the raven remains in my room  
No matter how much I implore  
No words can soothe him  
No prayer remove him  
And I must hear for evermore  
Quoth the raven, nevermore

Nevermore

Still no one cares  
  
You raise the bar  
Lost in a trance  
One bridge too far  
No second chance  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares

We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone  
  
You had a dream  
You cast the dice  
Your shady scheme  
You paid the price  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
With hearts of stone  
You lose again  
You're on your own  
  
A turning tide  
A streak of light  
Arms open wide  
The end's in sight  
And someone cares  
Yes someone cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone

See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
When I've gone insane  
  
I want to get out of here  
I want to get out of here  
I, I've gotta, I've gotta get out of here  
I, I gotta get out of here  
I, I gotta get out of here  
IgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahere  
Ya gotta let me out of here  
Let me outta her  
Etc  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
Blown up in my face  
  
I grabbed my hat and I got my coat  
And I, I ran into the street  
I saw a man that was choking there  
I guess he couldn't breathe  
Said to myself this is very strange  
I'm glad it wasn't me  
But now I hear those sirens callin'  
And so I am not free  
I didn't want to be  
I didn't want to be  
I didn't want to be  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
(I didn't want to be)  
I see it every day  
(Leave me alone  
I didn't want to be  
Don't touch me!)  
See my lonely mind explode  
When I've gone Insane

Alice Cooper,Be My Lover,/a/alice+cooper/be+my+lover_20157899.html,"She struts into the room  
Well I don't know her  
But with a magnifying glance  
I just sorta look her over  
  
We have a drink or two, well maybe three  
And then suddenly, she starts telling me her life story  
  
She says  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, if you want to, be my lover  
You better take me home  
Cause it's a long long way to paradise  
And I'm still on my own.  
  
Told her that I came from Detroit City  
And I played guitar in a long haired rock and roll band  
She asked me why the singer's name was Alice  
I said 'listen baby, you really wouldn't understand'  
  
And I said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On my own,  
  
Oh, baby, if you want to, be my lover  
You better take me home,  
Cause it's a long, long way, to paradise,  
And I'm still on my own, own

Alice Cooper,Be With You Awhile,/a/alice+cooper/be+with+you+awhile_20163704.html,"I wish I could tell you something you didn't know  
I wish I could give you something you didn't owe  
I wish I could tell you a joke to make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
I just want to take you somewhere you haven't been  
Find an old time movie where we don't know the end  
Lost in the radio, drive another mile  
So I could be with you awhile  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
Tired of serious conversation  
Tangled up in situations  
I feel so free 'cause you want nothing from me  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some hopeless vagabond asleep there on your floor  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you....

Hey Hey  
I guess I'm a loner and I don't fit in (No...)  
I ain't too comfortable in my skin (oh...)  
An' I don't play well with the others  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
  
Hey Hey  
Hey Hey  
Nobody wants me hanging round  
Unless it's from a tree in the middle of town  
And I'm out of step with the others  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
So I defy maybe all rules maybe no rules  
  
My clothes don't make me  
My hair ain't cut right  
And I don't care much  
No I don't care at all  
  
I guess my brain is out of synch, I think  
  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide, I just can't decide

I'm ready for the second show  
Amazin', thing growing  
Just waitin' for the juice to flow  
  
But you're so very picturesque  
You're so very cold  
Tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul  
  
I'm hurting, I'm wanting  
I'm aching for another go  
You're squirming wet, baby  
Nothin' bad comin' very slow  
And it's burnin' holes in me  
  
You're so very picturesque  
You're so very cold  
It tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul... whoa-oh  
  
One spastic explosion  
Two pressure-cookers go insane  
It makes me act crazy  
I shiver but I love this game  
  
You're so very ordinary  
You're so very lame  
Tastes like whiskey on your lips  
And earthworms rule your brain

Alice Cooper,"Changing, Arranging",/a/alice+cooper/changing+arranging_20166511.html,"I'm changing, arranging  
Things I never thought I'd move before  
I'm changing, arranging  
To your personality I asked for it before  
I need a soul who'll never say what I feel  
Just fearing that I will accept the ideal  
I look up high and I swear all I see  
It's a carbon copy image of me  
I'm dying hard trying  
Baby, baby, for the rest of my life  
I'm trying hard dying  
Maybe, maybe he's trying to be my life  
I've got a never ending battle inside  
Just trying to rectify my personal pride  
I swear I don't know what it's got over me  
But I know it doesn't want to be free

But we'll make it through our blackest hour

And we've never heard of Billy Sunday
