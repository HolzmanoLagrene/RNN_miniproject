Elton John,Dancing In The End Zone,/e/elton+john/dancing+in+the+end+zone_20046973.html,"Have you ever had a good time turn bad  
When the leaves turn brown  
And the shattered glass just splinters  
It's days like this that you can't resist  
A long tall drink  
And a big yellow sun in the winter  
And you can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
And you can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
Did you ever pray you could stay away  
Company excluded  
From the curse of the family circle  
In a big round room on the edge of the moon  
There's a shooting star  
In a race for the final hurdle  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
And you can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
No need to worry, no need to worry  
No need to worry when you dance alone  
You already made it, you already made it  
When you're dancing in the end zone  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
You can go dancing  
In the end zone  
You can go dancing  
In the end zone  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing in the end zone  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing in the end zone  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing in the end zone

I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye  
Oh it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes  
  
They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been  
Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen  
Oh and he should know, he's been there enough  
I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much  
  
Daniel my brother you are older than me  
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal  
Your eyes have died, cuz' you see more than I  
Daniel you're a star in the face of the skies

I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain  
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye

Elton John,Dark Diamond,/e/elton+john/dark+diamond_20046638.html,"Oh, I'm a dark diamond  
I've turned hard and cold  
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul  
There's two sides of a mirror  
One I couldn't break through  
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you  
  
Tell me how does it work  
How do you make things fit  
Spent all my life trying to get it right  
I've put it together and it falls apart  
I thought to myself I might understand  
But when the wall's built  
And the heart hardens  
You get a dark diamond  
Dark diamond  
  
Oh, I'm a dark diamond  
But you're something else  
You read me more than I read myself  
The one star I could count on  
Only comet I could trust  
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love

Elton John,Day Is Done,/e/elton+john/day+is+done_20192064.html,"When the day is done  
Down to Earth then sinks the sun  
Along with everything that was lost and won  
When the day is done  
  
When the day is done  
Hope so much your race will be all run  
Then you find you jumped the gun  
Have to go back where you begun  
When the day is done  
  
When the night is cold  
Some get by but some get old  
Just to show life's not made of gold  
When the night is cold  
  
When the bird has flown  
Got no one to call your own  
Got no place to call your home  
Now the bird has flown  
  
When the game's been fought  
Newspaper blowing across the court  
Lost much sooner than you would have thought  
Now the game's been fought  
  
When the party's through  
Seems so very sad for you  
Didn't do the things you meant to do  
Now there's no time to to start anew  
Now the party's through  
  
When the day is done  
Down to Earth then sinks the sun  
Along with everything that was lost and won  
When the day is done  
Day is done  
When the day is done

For many years  
I've lived my life  
Publicly  
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust  
I really trust  
And everytime I find someone I like  
Gotta worry about  
If it's really me  
That they see  
And I thought you were the one, yeah  
  
Deep inside I wish that they could see  
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary  
Deep inside I wish that they could see  
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary  
  
I don't have a lot of friends  
And sometimes I have to wonder  
Is it cash they see when they look at me  
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free  
So I made the choice to be  
Good to those who are good to me  
Don't judge me, don't think I'm bitter  
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary  
  
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary  
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary

Elton John,Did He Shoot Her?,/e/elton+john/did+he+shoot+her_20046191.html,"Sling your hook in with him baby  
He's a real sharp-shooter now  
If he's out there hiding in the tall grass  
Tell him I said he was a coward  
  
This ain't any old western honey  
It's the twentieth century now  
But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy  
And he's hurt her then I want to know how  
  
Did he shoot her with his compromise  
Like a heart attack he can paralyze  
Or did he hang her in a noose  
On the telephone line  
  
Did he shoot her with a forty five  
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes  
Oh did he shoot that girl  
That used to be mine  
  
Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses  
The pay-off for the things, for the things he's done  
He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit  
Armed with a couple of guns  
  
If he wants to see it as a two reel movie  
He's living in the head of someone else  
But better take him down and dust him honey  
I want to hear the truth for myself  
  
Did he shoot her  
Did he shoot her

I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck  
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard  
But I'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard  
  
When I watch the police come by and move you on  
Well I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become  
Well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear  
But all you got was a mop up job washing other people's stairs  
  
I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl  
Someone grab that bitch by the ears  
Rub her down scrub her back  
And turn her inside out  
Cause I bet she hasn't had a bath in years  
  
Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls  
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl  
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself  
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped

My little boat - she rocks easy  
I've been catching catfish in the creek all day  
Oh, and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats  
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way  
  
Dixie Lily, chugging like a grand old lady  
Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun  
Plowing through the water with your whistles blowing  
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run  
  
Papa says that I'm a dreamer  
Says them 'squitas bit me one too many times  
Oh, but I never get lonesome living on the river  
Watching old Lily leave the world behind

There's a trunk in the corner  
I keep all my letters  
My bills and demands I keep too  
  
Well I can't help thinking  
About the times  
You were a wife of mine  
You aimed to please me  
Cooked black-eyed peas-me  
Made elderberry wine  
  
[Chorus]  
Drunk all the time  
Feeling fine on elderberry wine  
Those were the days  
We'd lay in the haze  
Forget depressive times  
How can I ever get it together  
Without a wife in line  
To pick the crop and get me hot  
On elderberry wine  
  
Round a tree in the summer  
A fire in the fall  
Flat out when they couldn't stand  
The bottle went round  
Like a woman down south  
Passed on from hand to hand

I haven't got the words  
It's a feeling that you can't control  
I suppose its like forgetting,  
Losing who you are,  
And at the same time,  
Something makes you whole,  
Its like that there's a music,  
Playing in your ear,  
And I'm listening, and I'm listening  
And then I disappear  
  
And then I feel a change  
Like a fire deep inside  
Something bursting me wide open  
Impossible to hide  
  
And suddenly I'm flying  
Flying like a bird  
Like electricity  
Electricity  
Sparks inside of me  
And I'm free, I'm free  
  
It's a bit like being angry,  
It's a bit like being scared,  
Confused and all mixed up,  
And mad as hell,  
It's like when you've been crying,  
And you're empty, and you're full,  
I don't know what it is,  
It's hard to tell,  
  
Its like that there's some music,  
Playing in your ear,  
But the music,  
Is impossible,  
Impossible to hear,  
  
But then I feel it move me,  
Like a burning deep inside,  
Something bursting me wide open  
Impossible to hide  
  
Then suddenly I'm flying  
Flying like a bird  
Like electricity  
Electricity  
Sparks inside of me  
And I'm free, I'm free

Oh oh whoa.

And your grace and style  
Cut me to the bone  
With your razor blade smile  
I watched you playing pool  
It's all around the school that I love you  
  
I love your gypsy hair  
And dark brown eyes  
Always unprepared  
For your pointed replies  
Cynical and lean  
I lie awake and dream about you  
  
If you only knew  
What I'm going through  
Time and again I get ashamed  
To say your name  
It's hard to grin and bear  
When you're standing there  
My lips are dry  
I catch your eye and look away  
  
Sitting in my room  
I've got it bad  
Crying for the moon  
They think I'm mad  
They say it isn't real  
But I know what I feel and I love you  
  
But I would give my life  
For a single night beside you

Talks to her sisters in the ground  
I saw a lie in the mirror this morning  
I heard a prophesy all around  
  
And Emily they come and go  
The shadows and the distant sounds  
But Emily don't be afraid  
When the weight of angels weighs you down  
  
Emily prays to a faded hero  
In a little frame clutched to her gown  
Hears the voice of promise in his memory  
Tonight's the night they let the ladder down  
In a cage sits a gold canary  
By a wicker chair and a rosewood loom  
As a soul ascends aboard the evening  
Canary sings to an empty room  
  
And Emily they come and go  
The shadows and the distant sounds  
But Emily don't be afraid  
When the weight of angels weighs you down

What happened here  
As the New York sunset disappeared  
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there  
Who lived here  
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot  
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop  
And now it all looks strange  
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain  
  
[Verse 2]  
And what's it for  
This little empty garden by the brownstone door  
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more  
Who lived here  
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot  
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop  
And we are so amazed we're crippled and we're dazed  
A gardener like that one, no-one can replace  
  
[Chorus]  
And I've been knocking but no one answers  
And I've been knocking most all the day  
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny  
Can't you come out to play?  
  
[Verse 3]  
And through their tears  
Some say he farmed his best in younger years  
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear  
Who lived there  
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot  
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop  
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls  
We hear, we hear your name

Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny

And I've been knocking but no one answers  
And I've been knocking most all the day  
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny

And I looked high and saw the empty sky  
If I could only, I could only fly  
I'd drift with them in endless space  
But no man flies from this place  
  
At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars  
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far  
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above  
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love  
  
Hey the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck  
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet  
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land  
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man

Little Dan and Becky waved goodbye  
They're gonna have to share the weight together  
Idle hands will see a good farm slowly die  
  
Gone to Shiloh  
For the Union  
Shoulder to shoulder  
Side by side  
Gone to Shiloh  
Hope springs eternal  
When flags and bullets start to fly  
  
April's come and the air smells fresh with rain  
They watched his shadow fade around the bend  
He's headed for a different kind of thunder  
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men  
  
Gone to Shiloh  
For the Union  
Shoulder to shoulder  
Side by side  
Gone to Shiloh  
Time passes slowly  
When flags and bullets start to fly  
  
The old black rooster sang him down that dirt road  
His step seemed bold, his manner fancy-free  
I pray we see him alive and well in the fall here  
Than that God-forsaken place in Tennessee  
  
Gone to Shiloh  
For the Union  
Shoulder to shoulder  
Side by side  
Gone to Shiloh  
Men stand united  
When flags and bullets start to fly  
  
After all of this  
If we should prevail  
Heaven help the South  
When Sherman comes their way

So goodbye yellow brick road  
Where the dogs of society howl  
You can't plant me in your penthouse  
I'm going back to my plough  
  
Back to the howling old owl in the woods  
Hunting the horny back toad  
Oh I've finally decided my future lies  
Beyond the yellow brick road  
  
What do you think you'll do then  
I bet that'll shoot down your plane  
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics  
To set you on your feet again  
  
Maybe you'll get a replacement  
There's plenty like me to be found  
Mongrels who ain't got a penny  
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

Staring at the same four walls  
Waiting for the working day to end

I curse at you and tell you  
How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men  
How I've struggled for my money  
Sweated blood to get us by, yeah  
Well I'm tired of it honey  
Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while  
  
All you hear are hard luck stories  
And the ways I look at life  
And the way I think the world treats me  
And the way that I treat my wife  
  
I never seem to look at you  
And see that somewhere underneath  
A pair of tired eyes are crying out  
Well you know I work hard all day long  
Let me kiss you once with meaning  
Just to kill this nagging doubt  
Well you don't deny I do you proud  
And you expect me to be tired  
You say there's no future in our lives  
While I persist I'm putting out the fire  
  
All you hear are hard luck stories  
Just a few well chosen words  
'Cause you're still the woman of a working man  
You've got the heart of a working girl

Twirl around and take a chance

Nothing comes for free

Running through an autumn shower  
Bumping in to someone else like me

It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn  
  
Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired  
Where you get to the stage, where you're not even tired  
Kicking your heels till the time comes around  
To pick up your bags and head out of town  
  
Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock-and-roll man

And you ain't seen nothing till you've been  
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn

Better get back to the woods.""  
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways  
And, oh, the change is gonna do me good  
  
You better get back, honky cat  
Living in the city ain't where it's at  
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine  
It's like trying to drink whiskey from a bottle of wine  
  
Well, I read some books, and I read some magazines  
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans  
And all the folks back home, well, said I was a fool  
They said, ""oh, believe in the Lord is the golden rule.""  
  
They said, ""stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm  
Living in the city, boy, is going to break your heart.""

How can you stop when your feet say go?

I run out the front door into the center of the street  
I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet  
  
I hear you after midnight from the inner city  
As every little Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty  
We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story  
We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory  
  
Well, this is my battleground, baby  
This is my plaything  
The only thing I've ever known  
Outside of a wedding ring  
  
And I swear I heard the night talking  
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless  
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken  
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken  
And all we ever do, is listen to the night talking  
  
On the burden of insanity, we can't find the cause  
On a flatbed truck, well, the home girl, she paints her claws  
There's a coward who gets his courage under cover of the dark  
And it's a strange breed of the devil, freeze at night to go walking in the
park

This is my plaything  
The only thing I've ever known  
Outside of a wedding ring

Tight in the brightest grenadine  
But I'd take all that I've seen  
For a slow drag with Josephine  
  
Josephine, Josephine  
But I'd trade all that I've seen for a slow drag with Josephine  
  
Gavotte, garrotes, Cotillions and slow Arabesques  
Drum-rolls and Farandoles were all made in jest  
But when you make that move  
I can't resist  
When will you declare your armistice?  
  
Josephine, Josephine  
But I'd trade all that I've seen for a slow drag with Josephine  
  
In another time and place a different fate was cast  
He tried to skeddle-daddle-do  
She might have slapped him  
Just for saying ""Grant one more chance before you pass""  
""Then curse the nurse that named me the first or bury me at last""  
  
And in three-quarter time  
The true and the false  
Dancing the ""Hesitation Waltz""  
Then comes the ""flirtation""  
And temptation  
Hip, hip hooray  
Listen to what I say  
Then you can take it away

Elvis Costello,Abandoned Masquerade,/e/elvis+costello/abandoned+masquerade_20726671.html,"(Music by Diana Krall, lyrics by Elvis Costello)  
  
The glitter on a paint and plaster face  
Is covering desire and disgrace  
We could be lovers  
But no one suspects at all  
Once you're inside that costume ball  
And now I'm sitting here before the mirror  
I have the skill still to disguise my tears  
Then as the magic starts to fade  
I find myself abandoning the masquerade  
  
Even though you're suffering  
You try to hide it  
And pretend you're so nonchalant  
You can cry a pool of tears  
And sit beside it  
Then perhaps you'll know what you want  
  
I hope you never feel this much despair  
Or know the meaning of that empty chair  
As the illusions that we made all fade away  
In this abandoned masquerade

Elvis Costello,Accidents Will Happen,/e/elvis+costello/accidents+will+happen_20047196.html,"Oh, I just don't know where to begin

Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
You used to be a victim now you're not the only one  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
I don't want to hear it cause I know what I've done  
  
There's so many fish in the sea  
That only rise up on the sweat and smoke of mercury  
But they keep you hangin' on  
They say you're so young  
Your mind is made up but your mouth is undone  
  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
You used to be a victim now you're not the only one  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
I don't want to hear it cause I know what I've done  
  
It's the damage that we do we never know  
It's the words that we don't say that scare me so  
There's so many people to see  
So many people to hangin' on and add to your collection  
But they keep you hangin' on  
Until you well hung  
Your mouth is make up but your mind is undone  
  
Accidents will happen  
They're only hit and run  
You used to be a victim now you're not the only one  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
I don't want to hear it cause I know what it  
I know what it  
I know what it done  
I know (x4)

I'm not going to get too sentimental

Did he leave your pretty fingers lying  
In the wedding cake?  
You used to hold him right in your hand.  
I'll bet he took all he could take.  
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking  
When I hear the silly things that you say.  
I think somebody better put out the big light,

Elvis Costello,All This Useless Beauty,/e/elvis+costello/all+this+useless+beauty_20047267.html,"It's at times such as this she'd be tempted to spit  
If she wasn't so ladylike  
She imagines how she might have lived  
Back when legends and history collide  
So she looks to her prince finding he's so charmingly  
Slumped at her side  
Those days are recalled on the gallery wall  
And she's waiting for passion or humor to strike  
  
What shall we do, what shall we do with all this useless beauty?  
All this useless beauty  
  
Good Friday arrived, the sky darkened on time  
Till he almost began to negotiate  
She held his head like a baby and said ""it's okay if you cry""  
Now he wants her to dress as if you couldn't guess  
He desires to impress his associates  
But he's part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased  
So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny  
  
[Chorus:]  
She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books  
That were later disgraced to face celluloid  
It won't even make sense, but you can bet  
If she isn't a sweetheart or plaything or pet  
The film turns her into an unveiled threat  
  
Nonsense prevails, modesty fails  
Grace and virtue turn into stupidity  
While the calendar fades almost all barricades to a pale compromise  
And our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts  
They still think they're the gods of antiquity  
If something you missed didn't even exist  
It was just an ideal, is it such a surprise?  
  
[Chorus x 2]

All the things that your eyes once promised  
I see in hers too  
Now your eyes are red from crying  
  
Almost blue  
Flirting with this disaster became me  
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be  
  
Almost blue  
It's almost touching it will almost do  
There is part of me that's always true...always  
Not all good things come to an end now it is only a chosen few  
I've seen such an unhappy couple  
  
Almost me  
Almost you  
Almost blue

Elvis Costello,American Without Tears,/e/elvis+costello/american+without+tears_20047373.html,"Outside in New Orleans the heat was almost frightening  
But my hotel room as usual was freezing and unkind  
On TV they prosecute anyone who's exciting  
So I put on my overcoat and went down to find  
  
In Revlon and Crimpelene they captured my heart  
To the strain of a piano and a cocktail murderess  
She was singing that ""It's Too Late"", I agreed with that part  
For two English girls who had changed their address  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it seems we've been crying for years and for years  
Now I don't speak any English, just American without tears  
Just American without tears  
  
One had been a beauty queen and the other was her friend  
They had known rogues and rascals and showbiz impresarios  
While the boys were licking Hitler they had something to defend  
From men armed with chewing gum and fine nylon hose  
By a bicycle factory as they sounded the siren  
And returned into the dance hall she knew he was the one  
Though he wasn't tall or handsome she laughed when he told her  
""I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham and this is Little John""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
At a dock in Southampton full of tearful goodbyes  
Newsreel commentators said ""Cheerio, G.I. brides""  
Soon they'll be finding the cold facts and lies  
New words for suspenders and young girls backsides  
  
Now I'm in America and running from you  
Like my grandfather before me walked the streets of New York  
And I think of all the women I pretend mean more than you  
When I open my mouth and I can't seem to talk  
  
Now it seems we've been crying for years and for years  
Now I don't speak any English just American without tears  
Just American without tears

Elvis Costello,...and In Every Home,/e/elvis+costello/and+in+every+home_10100367.html,"You turn to the sinister when you get the boot  
Sliding down the banister in your Sunday suit  
Lying on a slag heap of blankets and magazines  
She's only thirty-five going on seventeen  
You'd better roll over and go to sleep if you don't come clean  
  
[Chorus:]  
And in every home there will be lots of time  
I will be all yours you might have been admired  
(And in every home there will be lots of time)  
They say they're very sorry but you are not desired  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Because they don't deserve us  
  
Holding your life in your hand  
With an artificial limp wrist  
And so a young blade becomes a has-been  
Looking for a new twist  
  
A year after the wedding he broke all their china plates  
He's in prison now she's running with his mates  
Sees him every Sunday  
And he asks her where she's been  
She's only thirty-five going on seventeen  
She's going to cop a packet if he ever finds her  
In between the sheets

Elvis Costello,Ascension Day,/e/elvis+costello/ascension+day_20969315.html,"Not a soul was stirring  
Not a bird was singing, at least not within my hearing  
I was five minutes past caring  
Standing in the road just staring  
  
Thought I heard somebody pleading  
I thought I heard someone apologize  
Some fell down weeping  
Others shook their fists up at the skies  
And those who were left  
Seemed to be wearing disguises  
  
Now there's a queen in waiting  
Not enough loving and too much hating  
For the prince hidden within her man  
Always seems to be hesitating  
  
He said, ""Let her go, let her go, God bless her""  
""She hasn't been gone long enough for me to miss her""  
""Except every minute of every hour of every day when I wish I could possess
her""  
  
Forty days passed by  
Forty alibis  
So carry on...that way  
And in time...you'll pay  
But we'll all be together  
Come Ascension Day  
  
Not a hound was howling  
Or whimpering or prowling  
Now the wind had departed  
Not a leaf was hanging on the tree like when it started  
  
But I know they will return  
Like they've never gone away  
Come Ascension Day

To hold on to that girl, I had to let her go

Out on you

Trying so hard to be like the big boys

Trying to become a fixture  
Inch by inch trying to reach her  
All the way through the second feature  
Worrying about your physical fitness  
Tell me how you got this sickness, oh ohhhh..  
  
I was caught in the suction  
By a face like a truncheon  
I was down upon one knee  
Stroking her vanity  
  
I was stuck on a hammerhead  
I came alive and left for dead  
As my face returned to red  
Choking on my pride and pity  
  
We can talk (we can talk)  
Until your face is blue ('til your face is blue)  
We can talk but she'll get to you  
After you've been loved and hated  
By the ones you've watched and waited  
Found that they were overrated  
  
She'll be the one - when the party's over  
She'll be the one - when the girls have gone home  
She'll be the one - that you'll wish you'd held onto  
She'll be the one - but it's too late for you to  
She'll be the one - who knows all your history  
She'll be the one -

Took his neck and they give it a twist  
So you see you won't be missed in those complicated shadows  
  
You can say just what you like in a voice like a John Ford film  
Take the law into your hands  
You will soon get tired of killing  
In those complicated shadows  
Complicated shadows  
Complicated shadows  
Complicated shadows  
  
Go!

A little sip at noon  
You're tired and torn approaching dawn  
My penitent buffoon  
Wouldn't you think I'd know by now  
I shouldn't have entertained it  
Couldn't you keep that to yourself  
You cried for my forgiveness  
You say it sets you free  
You summon dear the shameful tears  
That spill all over me  
Wouldn't you think I'd know by now  
I shouldn't have entertained it  
Couldn't you keep that to yourself  
  
The penny rides at evening tide  
The vain requests  
The blush of the night  
And the blooming bush  
Where you failed every test  
What should I believe of you?  
What should I forget  
Am I innocent yet  
  
Is it the wife you would have beaten  
Is it the child you couldn't bear?  
I fear you have mistaken me  
For somebody who cares  
The sophisticated victim  
That you skilfully request  
You can hide behind your wishes  
You can hide behind despair  
And all the wretched syndroms  
That carry away the blame  
Couldn't you keep you keep that to yourself  
And wouldn't you shouldn't you couldn't you  
Keep that to yourself

Flies buzzing around the bulb

Heard an approaching train  
Drown out his desperate pulse  
A song with no refrain  
  
Country darkness  
  
She daydreams forbidden sings  
There must be something more  
The prison she lives in  
The one with the open door  
  
Country darkness  
  
The veil is covering  
A glistening and cruel blade  
Suffer little children  
Repent, unfaithful maid

Elvis Costello,Crawling To The U.s.a.,/e/elvis+costello/crawling+to+the+usa_20726648.html,"I thought I would go to the sea and shrink down very tiny  
And slide inside the telephone wire that runs under the briny  
Till I found there is a way of crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
You had better not go too far  
There's one way out, there's only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
Saw it late one night on a secret channel  
It's farther on along the tunnel  
It's way beyond the final station  
That's the one they never mention  
  
You had better not go too far  
There's one way out, there's only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
You don't have to pay them that much  
You had better bring your lunch  
It's undercover, around the houses  
Up your skirt and down your trousers  
  
You had better not go too far  
There's one way out, there's only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
She said, ""I catch you taking liberties and they do not impress me  
Attach me to your credit card and then you can undress me  
Everybody is on their knees except the Russians and the Chinese

Leave your mother and your father

Elvis Costello,Damnation's Cellar,/e/elvis+costello/damnations+cellar_20047352.html,"Did anybody notice, over marmalade and eggs  
In between the princess' legs  
What with wars and floods and beggars  
Not to mention stocks and shares  
If you have a moment to spare  
Can you write and reassure me that I have seen  
They're constructing a time machine  
There will be no need for the obituary pages  
We can have any hero from the bygone ages  
'Til the truth emerges, the argument rages  
  
[Chorus:]  
The major and the minor  
Turn from tallow into tar  
Should we leave them in their place?  
Down in damnation's cellar  
  
When any form of deity that you might enjoy  
Can be conjured with a test-tube and a flame  
If it's out there then science can explain it  
Or at least remove the blame  
And if there's is anyone you'd like to see again  
The speak up quickly  
  
Send us back Da Vinci then we don't have to ponder  
The maddening smile of ""La Giaconda""  
The critics say Nijinsky, the dancer, of course  
While the punters would probably prefer the horse  
You'll find it's quicker than history, cheaper than divorce  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Bring back Liberace or Ollie and Stan  
Shakespeare will have to wait his turn  
Elvis Presley and Puccini shall return  
I suppose we live and learn, though it's hard to believe as we  
Cheerfully burn  
It's curious  
Some will call for justice.  
There are murders to solve  
What about Hitler? or at least lee Harvey Oswald  
Give us this day and everything we squander  
Anyone beautiful  
Somebody blonder  
They'll never please mankind, so lie back and enjoy it  
Stop press: they've just decided to destroy it

How temptation lured she and I  
Now I know it was only fascination  
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie

After all, she's got feelings too  
But it took a little longer than I thought it would

She wanted to hold me forever  
And this lipstick shows her final try  
And these tears on my shoulder are proof that she failed

The same eyes, the same lips, the same lie from  
Your tongue trips  
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror  
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror  
  
Now the flagstone streets where the newspaper shouts ring to the boots of
roustabouts  
But you're never in any doubt, there's something happening somewhere  
  
You chase down the road 'til your fingers bleed  
On a fiberglass tumbleweed  
  
You can blow around the town, but it all shuts down the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So you bay for the boy in the tiger-skin trunks  
They set him up, set him up on the stool  
He falls down, falls down like a drunk  
And you drink 'til you drool  
And it's his story you'll flatter  
You'll stretch him out like a saint  
But the canvas that he splattered will be the  
Picture that you never paint  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A stripping puppet on a liquid stick gets into it pretty thick  
A butterfly drinks a turtle's tears, but how do you know he really needs it?  
  
As a butterfly feeds on a dead monkey's hand,  
Jesus wept he felt abandoned  
You're spellbound baby there's no doubting that  
Did you ever see a stare like a Persian cat?

Or about my strange resemblance to some old flame

And throw the jockeys from their throne  
When there are pitches left to dodge  
And lions left to tame  
But it's nothing but a dirty rotten shame  
It's a dirty rotten shame  
That when you're frivolous and strong  
It isn't youth, its fearlessness  
That has been wasted on the young  
The cruel are in the cradle  
And the bishop's in the bag  
It's nothing but a dirty rotten shame  
  
Now I find life a millionaire  
That brags for rags and jewels  
A snarling pup is wild enough  
But as his anger proves  
He's left to sharpen useless tools  
That tear and graze and finer phrase  
But few are worth the name  
It's nothing but a dirty rotten shame  
  
It's a dirty rotten shame  
And that is not an idle boast  
When all your courage and your strength  
Will leave you as you need it most  
When there are lamps to dampen  
And cauliflowers to flip  
It's nothing but a dirty rotten shame

The birds all fly from the branches in a panic  
And a back-fire echoes down the hillside  
As the last headline report dies

Ice is melting at the distant Pole  
The gin and tonic glasses overflow

The precious little else that I could say  
Your stupid tears of laughter washed away

And it flickers on, tries so hard to be scandalous  
A child keeps beating on a toy drum  
And the tablets dropped on your tongue

""I might not be there when you look again""

The hour that he passed, unwound and stopped

How did they flood the plain?  
Did they erase the name?

Appeared to turn your coat

In challenge they look on  
Women he has wanted grow old too soon  
He tilts their tired faces  
Gently to the spoon

The wires in the walls are humming  
Some song-some mysterious song  
Bars in her head  
Beating frantic and snowblind

They say that travel broadens the mind, 'til you can't get your head out of
doors  
  
I'm sitting here on the top of the world  
I hang around in the longest night  
Until each beast has gone bed and then I say  
""God bless"" and turn out the light  
While you lie in the dark, afraid to breathe and you beg and you promise  
And you bargain and you plead  
Sometimes you confuse me with Santa Claus  
It's the big white beard I suppose  
I'm going up to the pole, where you folks die of cold  
I might be gone for a while if you need me  
  
Now I'm dead, now I'm dead, now I'm dead,  
Now I'm dead, now I'm dead and you're all  
Going on to meet your reward  
  
Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared?  
Are you scared?  
You might have never heard, but God's comic

Elvis Costello,Good Year For The Roses,/e/elvis+costello/good+year+for+the+roses_20047598.html,"I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick on the cigarettes there in the ashtray  
Lyin' cold the way you left 'em, but at least your lips caressed them while  
You packed  
Or the lip-print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and didn't
drink  
But at least you thought you wanted it, that's so much more than I can say  
For me  
  
What a good year for the roses  
Many blooms still linger there  
The lawn could stand another mowin'  
Funny I don't even care  
As you turn to walk away  
As the door behind you closes  
The only thing I have to say  
It's been a good year for the roses  
  
After three full years of marriage, it's the first time that you haven't  
Made the bed  
I guess the reason we're not talkin', there's so little left to say we  
Haven't said  
While a million thoughts go racin' through my mind, I find I haven't said a
word  
From the bedroom the familiar sound of a baby's cryin' goes unheard  
  
What a good year for the roses  
Many blooms still linger there  
The lawn could stand another mowin'  
Funny I don't even care  
As you turn to walk away  
As the door behind you closes  
The only thing I have to say  
It's been a good year for the roses

Elvis Costello,Goon Squad,/e/elvis+costello/goon+squad_20047202.html,"Mother, Father, I'm here in the zoo  
I can't come home 'cause I've grown up too soon  
I got my sentence  
I got my command  
They said they'd make me major if I met all their demands  
  
I could be a corp'ral into corp'ral punishment  
Or the gen'ral manager of a large establishment  
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod  
But I never thought they'd put me in the  
  
Goon squad  
They've come to look you over and they're giving you the eye  
Goon squad  
They want you to come out to play  
You'd better say goodbye  
  
Some grow just like their dads  
And some grow up too tall  
Some go drinking with the lads  
Some are no fun at all  
  
And you must find the proper place  
For everything you see  
But you'll never get to make a lampshade out of me  
  
I could join a chain of males or be the missing link  
Looking for a lucky girl to put me in the pink  
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod  
But I never thought they'd put me in the  
  
Good squad...  
  
Mother, Father, I'm doing so well  
I'm making such progress now that you can hardly tell  
I fit in a little dedication  
With one eye on the clock  
They caught you under medication  
You could be in for a shock  
  
Thinking up the alibis that ev'ryone's forgotten  
Just another mummy's boy gone to rotten  
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod  
But I never thought they'd put me in the  
  
Goon squad...

Elvis Costello,Green Shirt,/e/elvis+costello/green+shirt_20047203.html,"There's a smart young woman on a light blue screen  
Who comes into my house every night.  
And she takes all the red, yellow, orange and green  
And she turns them into black and white.  
  
But you tease, and you flirt  
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt  
You can please yourself but somebody's gonna get it  
  
Better cut off all identifying labels  
Before they put you on the torture table  
  
'Cause somewhere in the ""Quisling Clinic""  
There's a shorthand typist taking seconds over minutes  
She's listening in to the Venus line  
She's picking out names  
I hope none of them are mine  
  
But you tease, and you flirt...  
  
Never said I was a stool pigeon  
I never said I was a diplomat  
Everybody is under suspicion  
But you don't want to hear about that  
  
'Cause you tease, and you flirt...  
  
Better send a begging letter to the big investigation  
Who put these fingerprints on my imagination?  
  
You tease, and you flirt...

You can please yourself but somebody's gonna get it

Polishing my precious china  
Don't you know I'm an animal

It will fade

You said that you'd be mine for life  
And now you say you're leaving  
If I could hold you once more  
Before you go  
When I approach you just lash out

Elvis Costello,Hidden Shame,/e/elvis+costello/hidden+shame_20047220.html,"I'm sorry to say that you don't know me  
I'm sad in ways you never understood  
Each time I try to tell the ugly truth  
You always let it pass you by  
  
You said I'd never tell you a lie  
Just because I could  
Did you really think I was a bad man?  
  
You always said that that should be my middle name  
But you don't know the half of it  
You don't know how that name fits  
You don't know my hidden shame  
  
Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me  
  
Well, there's a different kind of prison  
And it don't even have to look much like a cell  
It's already on your mind, boy, we can see it in your eyes  
So, here's the bars and walls as well  
  
Well, you know I'm never coming home, babe  
You said you'd stand by me until I cleared my name  
Sure it's easy to be strong  
When you know the charge is wrong  
But the days and weeks get long  
When you've got a hidden shame  
  
Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me  
  
I had a friend when I was just a boy  
We were like brothers, we would run and hide  
And we went walking on a high hillside  
And I really don't how it happened  
  
He turned to me and had this strange look in his eye  
And not a single word was spoken  
I must have pushed him but I don't remember why  
And all at once, he lay there broken  
And I walked down without him and I didn't even sigh  
  
Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me  
  
They say you always hurt the one you love  
And I'm not saying if I did or if I didn't  
But like my shame that kind of love is always hidden  
They locked me up here for the ideas in my head  
They never got me for the thing I really did  
  
Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

To shut me away as you walk through  
Lovers laughing in their amateur hour  
Holding hands in the corridors of power  
Even though I'm with somebody else right now  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
There's a new kind of dedication  
Maybe you'll find it down the tunnel  
Maybe I got above my station  
Maybe you're only changing channel  
  
Even though you're nowhere near me  
And I know you kiss him so sincerely now  
Even though the signal's indistinct  
And you worry what silly people think  
Who just can't wait to feel so frozen out  
I bet he thinks that he was chosen out of millions  
I suppose he'll never know about  
  
High fidelity

Elvis Costello,Home Truth,/e/elvis+costello/home+truth_20047313.html,"I hung up the phone tonight  
Just as you said I love you  
Once this would have been coincidence  
Now these things start to bother me  
You still close your eyes when I kiss you  
And I close mine too  
But we didn't open them again  
Quite as wide as we should  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
Does your touch feel the same as it should do  
Or is it someone quite similar  
Who killed me with kindness last night  
Now do I look at all familiar?  
But none of these things seem to matter  
Since we've grown apart  
I'd put back the pieces of what's shattered  
But I don't know where to start  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
And I feel like a clown  
It's tearing me up  
It's tearing me down  
  
You say which are the lies that you tell me  
Well where do I begin?  
So I turn on the TV again  
And the world comes crashing in  
Is it my shirt or my toothpaste  
That is whiter than white?  
Is it the lies that I tell you  
Or the lies that I might?  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends

Honey are you straight or are you blind?  
  
She walked in and your eyes flew out the door  
You squeezed my hand 'til the circulation ceases

She's the kind of doll that you'd like to pull to pieces

A deeper red than the petal

It's so hard to say the words I feel

It's time to stop pretending things are real  
  
'Cause I've been living deep in sin, I've been living blind  
And I just don't know what's right or wrong  
To take a chance on losing you is such a silly thing to do  
A chance I might wake up and find you gone  
  
Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue  
Any private flame could be a lie  
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you  
But I know I'll only make you cry  
  
A thief can only steal from you  
He cannot break your heart  
He can never touch the precious things inside  
Someone like you should surely be  
  
Miles and miles away from me  
Then you'd never care how much I lied  
So try to understand the pain  
It takes so long when I explain  
Please don't you forget how much I lied  
How much I lied

Somebody else's paint

Every fleeting thought is a pearl  
And beautiful people stampede to the doorway  
Of the funniest fucker in the world  
  
They're here to help you  
Satisfy your desire  
There's a bright future for all you professional liars

They emptied out all the asylums, they emptied out all the jails  
The ""new bruise"" was the name of a dance craze  
By ""Jesus cross and the cruel nails""  
Followed up by ""torturing little beaver""  
With their contraption of barbed wire  
Between the fear and the fever lies all the rejection they require  
They'll be howling by midnight, they'll be drooling by dawn  
Skulls shrunk down to the size of their brains  
Heads shaven and shorn

Trapped in the house of the perpetual sucker  
Where bitterness always ends so pitifully  
You always had to dress up your envy in some half-remembered  
Philosophy

Whose ever bad intention has been purged  
You could've walked out any time you wanted but face it you  
Didn't have the courage  
I guess that makes you a full time hypocrite or some kind of  
Twisted dilettante  
Funny though people don't usually get so ugly 'til they think  
They know what they want  
Scratch your own head stupid  
Count up to three  
Roll over on your back  
Repeat after me

Lip reading threats and false alarms  
There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself  
And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn

Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt  
That it's you that I'm dreaming about  
Do I have to draw you a diagram?  
All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands  
  
With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze  
Checkmate in three moves in your heyday  
But the girls don't listen to your line anymore  
Now you're part of someone else  
  
On the factory floor and you still say ""Wheres the action?""  
Now you manufacture happiness  
And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction

Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder  
In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before

You know I love you more than slightly  
Although I've never said it like this before

Drinking your way to drydock

Living in the state of shock  
  
I just can't believe I am responsible for this  
What the makeup hides can't be hidden with a kiss  
  
When I'm talking in tongues I go where you lead  
I don't make you plead, oh I need you  
How I'd like to fix her in a picture of rage  
How I'd like to catch her when she's acting her age  
But when she's laying stretched out on the floor  
It's no mystery to me anymore

And I wonder how he would look now  
  
Would our kids grow sullen or grow strong?  
Would their limbs bronze in solitude and sun?  
I like the way it feels but then  
I rarely dream of anyone  
  
In the songs of shame and the tales of dread  
Where they seal the lovers' lips with lead  
And all the vines wind through their eyes  
Oh but no one knows this passion now  
Oh no one knows this passion now  
  
So I keep this fancy to myself  
I keep my lipstick twisted tight  
I long to fall to sleep again  
I dreamed of my old lover last night  
I long to fall to sleep again  
'Cause I dreamed of my old lover last night

I was talking to you when you took my tongue away  
I hear a melody and I feel so ashamed  
I got nothing you'd need and you're so hard to blame  
  
I hear a melody, I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and you're so hard to blame  
  
You will never work out I know that's easy to see  
So the way that I want you to stay is hidden in me  
You'll never know the fool I'm feeling tonight  
But it's best that you never know 'cause I know it's not right  
  
I hear a melody, I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and I know it's not right  
  
I hear a melody, I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and I know it's not right

With his eyes upon the secret places he'd like to undo  
Still he knows who knows who and where and how  
And I hope you're happy now  
  
He's got all the things you need and some that you will never  
But you make him sound like frozen food, his love will last forever  
Still he knows what you want and what you don't allow  
And I hope you're happy now  
  
I hope that you're happy now like you're supposed to be  
And I know that this will hurt you more than it hurts me  
  
He's acting innocent and proud still you know what he's after  
Like a matador with his pork sword, while we all die of laughter  
In his turquoise pajamas and motorcycle hat  
I hope you're happy now because you'll soon put pay to that  
I knew then what I know now I never loved you anyhow  
And I hope you're happy now

Before we weaken 'cause we already know this is wrong  
I could give in, sometimes I think that I will  
Despite the temptation I try to be very strong  
In my reluctance seems a surprise  
It's not 'cause I don't want you  
  
But I just  
Know I must... Hesitate  
  
Because I still have that other girl  
In my head  
I still have that other girl in my head  
  
There may be ugly rumors that  
I have been lying  
There may be angry tears, but  
They're never worth the crying  
  
That is why  
Sometimes I... Hesitate  
  
Because I still have that other girl  
In my head  
I still have that other girl in my head  
I still have that other girl in my head

Elvis Costello,I Thought I'd Write To Juliet,/e/elvis+costello/i+thought+id+write+to+juliet_20047359.html,"I thought I'd write to Juliet's, for she would understand  
And when someone is already dead they can no longer let you down  
Instead I find myself talking to you, as my oldest friend  
Tell me how I can advise someone, that I don't even know,  
To welcome death  
  
For I received a letter that is worth reporting  
And though it may raise a cynical smile  
It leaves a sinking feeling  
Like when a soldier in a story says to the sergeant...  
""Have you seen my pride and joy?...""  
You know the rest...and it's no joke...forgive me please as I quote...  
""This is a letter of thanks, as I'm so bored here in I can't say where.  
So I'm writing to people that I may never meet  
And I was thinking if something you said...""  
  
""I'm a female soldier, my name is Constance.  
I enlisted in the military needing funds for college  
I'm twenty-three years old and if I do get home alive  
I imagine I may think again...""  
  
""I'm sleeping with my eyes open for fear of attack  
Your words are a comfort, they're the best thing that I have  
Apart from family pictures and, of course, my gas mask  
I don't know why I am writing to you""

In my arms  
She said she would always stay  
But I was cruel  
And I treated her like a fool  
I threw it all away  
  
Once I had mountains  
In the palm of my hand  
And rivers to drink through everyday  
But I must have been mad  
I never knew what I had  
Until I threw it all away  
  
Love is all there is  
That makes the world go round  
Love as only love  
Can't be denied  
  
Not matter what you think about it  
Just won't be able to do without it  
Take a tip from one who's tried  
  
So when you find someone  
Who gives you all of her love  
Take it to your heart don't  
Let is stray  
'Cause one thing for certain  
You will surely be hurting  
If you throw it all away  
If you throw it all away

And turn off the lights as well  
If you were frightened  
Then listen:  
But I don't think you'd like it  
Such a nice kid  
  
Nobody's lookin' now  
I throw my toys around  
  
Somebody's bein' very bad  
I wonder who it can be  
Somebody's goin' to get in trouble  
I know it isn't me  
  
I'm just a little angel  
But you don't know what I've done  
When your back's turned  
Nobody's lookin' now  
I throw my toys around  
  
Pick up those building blocks  
Chop off the baby's locks  
Swing dolly by the hair  
Put down that teddy bear  
Slam dunk that happy clown  
I throw my toys around  
  
I've got no time for bedtime stories  
I'm not a little child  
Everything makes me furious  
And everything makes me wild  
  
If you were frightened  
Then whistle:  
And they'll come runnin' to you  
As you boo-hoo  
  
Nobody's looking now

I hate this bloody big bed of mine when you're not here  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down  
And nail my feet up where my head should be  
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown  
And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly  
  
Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm  
In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm  
You have this expression dear no words could take its place  
And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dance halls  
If you'll wear it proudly through the snake pits and catcalls  
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss  
If you don't know what is wrong with me  
Then you don't know what you've missed  
  
We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight  
When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright  
But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess  
And a handful of eagerness says ""What do you suggest?""

So, you dodge the lady-killer, who came creepin' 'cross the floor  
Then you caught up in a whirlwind, you got blown right out the door  
  
Oh, yes it was a whirlwind, sweet romance was on your side  
If you wanna dance on my face, you must tell me why you lied  
  
Imagination is a powerful deceiver  
When you try to believe her just a little too much  
Imagination is a powerful deceiver  
I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch  
  
I see a look of recognition, so well hidden in your eye  
And your peepshow regulations, they just don't seem to apply,  
Well, did I see you in the circus, in the ring without a hand  
Now you think that you can curse us, steal the show and stop the band  
  
Oh, you can follow your dreams, oh but please don't lead me on,  
If you wanna bleed in my face, you were here and now you're gone

I know it makes sense but it's hard for me to stay away  
But if this is how it has to be  
Maybe it's just a feeling  
That I could name  
But I'd probably best blame...impatience  
You can't miss - what you've never known  
It's quite absurd how you started disturbing me so  
Sometimes - when I am all alone  
I lose my senses  
I have no defenses to go  
But if this is how I lose my heart  
Then I shall just embrace that  
My pulse is racing still  
I'm secretly thrilled  
By the laughter that tumbled  
And the tears that I spilled  
As far as I know no one ever got killed  
By impatience  
Tell me - is there danger still?  
I took no heed so a word might as well be deed  
Although - I'd really like to see you now  
I'm almost certain it can't be accomplished with speed  
So, if this is how I'll bide my time  
Then I will set it down  
Til we lose our caution  
I'll honor your order  
Cause it's such sweet torture  
To carry this torch  
In the light of temptation  
Beyond conversation and all expectation  
Pausing a moment or two just to mention...

You can take me over  
You can give me a lip  
You can take me under  
You can give me the slip  
Take off everything or tear me off a strip

And another in the clip

You can take me outside  
You can take me apart  
You can take me upstairs  
You can take me to heart  
You made me love you when  
You thought you were so smart  
Don't try to stop me when  
You told me to start

And everything seemed just right  
I couldn't ask for more  
But baby, I've been wrong before

And hold my hand like you do  
Then she left me  
And broke my heart in two  
  
See her face

Oh baby, I've been wrong before

And I was everybody's boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
  
You won't know who to thank  
You won't know who to blame  
It's just a part of the murdering game  
Cause down in the fleshpots  
Where they pay you in pounds  
They're laughing like drains  
And baying like bloodhounds  
For the Jack of all parades  
The Jack of all parades  
  
Once I knew a girl  
That looked so much like Judy Garland  
That people would stop and give her money  
And everybody was Frankie, Jimmy or Bobby  
Not the Jack, the Jack of all parades,  
Oh the Jack, the Jack of all parades,  
Oh the Jack, of all parades.  
  
Now the way that I feel is no longer news  
You know my love and how to refuse it  
Cause you know where the door is  
And how to use it  
Oh you know you do  
  
But from my checkered past  
To this shattered terrace  
Where you can't keep your mind off  
The crimes of Paris  
And you can't keep your peace  
And try to forget it  
And I can't forgive you  
For things you haven't done yet  
  
Oh I was anybody's boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
  
When we first met I didn't know what to do  
My old love lines were all worn out on you  
And the world walked 'round my mouth  
I didn't mean to say it  
I just blurted it out  
As you pretended not to notice  
Or be taken aback  
And I loved you there and then  
It's as simple as that  
  
Oh I was everybody's boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
Oh the Jack of all parades

You said that he could tell her anything  
She even held him when he was crying  
And made her feel she was the only one  
You knew that he was lying when he said he was lying  
  
Love is short and painful, that she finally made sense  
Of the love he had for the one and only King of Confidence

That he twists with nicotine fingers  
As he drops his cigarette ash  
And someone comes and sweeps it up  
And then he doffs his cap  
And there's a rat in someone's bedroom  
And they're shutting someone's trap  
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces  
  
And the doors swing back and forward, from the past into the present  
And the bedside crucifixion turns from wood to phosphorescent.  
And they're moving problem families from the South up to the North,  
Mother's crying over some soft soap opera divorce,  
And you say you didn't do it, but you know you did of course,  
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces.

The sedated homes of England, are theirs to vandalize.  
  
So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,  
And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.  
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces.  
  
You're the twinkle in your daddy's eye, a name you spray and scribble,  
You made the girls all turn their heads, and in turn they made you miserable.  
To be the heir apparent, to the kingdom of the invisible.  
  
So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,  
And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.  
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces.

Elvis Costello,Little Savage,/e/elvis+costello/little+savage_20047338.html,"I would have waited all my life  
Just to make love out of something other than spite  
But the beauty is the beast you're baiting  
Should really be worth the waiting  
  
[Chorus:]  
You do something very special to  
Mr. Average  
Now the lamb lies with the lion  
He's just a little savage  
  
And so you turn your back on me  
And all the hot air that only echoes stale tobacco  
  
Actions speak louder now than words  
By just a fraction  
What's the use of saying I love you whe I'm drinking to distraction  
We save our sanity  
By saying such and such  
After all its been discussed  
You say you must be touched  
  
[Chorus]

Elvis Costello,Little Triggers,/e/elvis+costello/little+triggers_20047510.html,"Little triggers that you pull with your tongue  
Little triggers, I don't want to be hung up, strung up  
When you don't call up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Little sniggers on your lips  
Little triggers in your grip  
Little triggers--my hand on your hip  
  
Thinkin' all about those censored sequences  
Worryin' about the consequences  
Waiting until I come to my senses  
Better put it all in present tenses  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Worryin' about the common decency  
When it is only a question of frequency  
When you say OK but you've got cheek to be  
Sayin' you're tired of me when you don't even weaken these  
Little sniggers on your lips  
Little triggers in your grip  
Little triggers--my hand on your hip

Elvis Costello,Living In Paradise,/e/elvis+costello/living+in+paradise_20047511.html,"I don't like those other guys looking at your curves  
I don't like you walking 'round with physical jerks  
Everything they say and do is getting on my nerves  
Soon they will be lucky to be picking up the perks  
'Cause when they pull the shutters down and throw up in the dark  
They'll find that all the dogs outside bite much worse than they bark  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here we are living in paradise, living in luxury  
Oh, the thrill is here but it won't last long  
You better have your fun before it moves along  
And you're already looking for another fool like me  
  
I call you Betty Felon 'cause you are a pretty villain  
And I think that I should tell them that you'd make a pretty killing  
'Cause meanwhile up in heaven they are waiting at the gate  
Saying, ""We always knew you'd make it, didn't think you'd come this late""  
And now it's much too dangerous to stop what you've begun  
When everyone in paradise carries a gun  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Later in the evening when arrangements are made  
I'll be at the keyhole outside your bedroom door  
'Cause I'm the first to know whenever the plans are laid  
That never go further than floor to floor  
You think that I don't know the boy that you're touching  
But I'll be at the video and I will be watching  
  
[Chorus:]

Elvis Costello,Lost In The Stars,/e/elvis+costello/lost+in+the+stars_20047566.html,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land  
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand  
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand  
And one little star fall alone  
  
Then the Lord God hunted through the wild night air  
For the little dark star in the wind down there  
And he stated and promised he'd take special care  
So it wouldn't get lost again  
  
Now, man don't mind if the stars grow dim  
And the clouds blow over and darken him  
So long as the Lord God's watching over him  
Keeping track how it all goes on  
  
But I've been walking through the night and the day  
Till my eyes get weary and my hair turns grey  
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away  
Forgetting the promise that we heard him say  
  
And we're lost out here in the stars  
Little stars, big stars  
Blowing through the night  
  
And we're lost out here in the stars  
Little stars, big stars  
Blowing through the night  
  
And we're lost out here in the stars

Elvis Costello,Love For Tender,/e/elvis+costello/love+for+tender_20047299.html,"You won't take my love for tender  
You can put your money where your mouth is  
But you're so unsure  
I could be a miser or a big spender  
But you might get much more than you bargained for  
Check in on a checkmate  
Grassing on a classmate  
So beautiful and fortunate  
You're the one who hates to love  
But he's the one who loves to hate  
He can fix you all for good  
Because he is the neighbourhood  
You can get money for blood  
Blood money for doing no good  
  
Better tell me now, have you made your selection?  
Are you ready for correction?  
Cause the wages of sin are an expensive infection  
It'll make you bankrupt  
Better pay up now, don't interrupt  
So in love, I'm so sincere  
Just like a well-known financier  
You know I've never been corrupt  
  
I'll pay you a compliment  
And you'll think I am innocent  
You can total up the balance sheet  
And never know if I'm a counterfeit  
You won't take my love for tender...

Elvis Costello,Love Went Mad,/e/elvis+costello/love+went+mad_20047460.html,"I've looked at it every way I can  
From under and above  
And every chance i've had  
My love went mad  
Love went mad love went mad  
You you feel like I feel?  
Do you have a heart?  
Do you have a heart of iron and steel?  
  
Are you a man now you wear a man's hat?  
Are you a man now or are you a rat?  
You go to church quiet as a mouse  
You're a big cheese now in the workhouse  
With these vulgar fractions of the treble clef  
I wish you luck with a capital 'f'  
A self-made mug is hard to break  
A silent partner in someone else's mistake  
  
Every day goes by without a hitch  
You feel the urge becoming an itch  
The boys in blue are hard to catch  
They're busy turning piccadilly  
Into brands hatch  
But with your fingers in your ears  
Feeling bright as a button  
Thinking 'thank god there'll be no more  
Lamb dressed as mutton'  
Playing family favorites on a tissue and a comb  
Dying a thousand deaths  
In the safety of your own home

Elvis Costello,Lover's Walk,/e/elvis+costello/lovers+walk_20047530.html,"I won't walk with my head bowed  
(Be on) Beyond caution where lovers walk  
My love walks where three's a crowd  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers walk, lovers scramble  
Beyond caution where the lovers walk  
Lovers step, shuffle and gamble  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers trip, lovers stumble  
Lovers dip, lovers fumble  
Lovers lip where love has crumbled  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers strut, lovers stroll, lovers leap  
Lovers late, lovers wait  
Making promises that they can't keep  
Lovers link up arm and arm  
Lovers slink up, lovers charm  
Lovers drink up and come to harm  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Love is gone and it's no one's fault  
Love has stopped here, lovers halt  
Lovers don't walk, lovers run  
Will you look what love has done  
Will you look what love has done  
Will you look what love has done  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Now love's limping on a lover's crutch  
Looking for a hand with a personal touch  
Beyond caution where lovers walk

Elvis Costello,Luxembourg,/e/elvis+costello/luxembourg_20047531.html,"Dressed up like a dog's dinner  
Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth  
If this is a dog's life  
Then you're the cat's clothes  
They hire out your sons  
And hire out your daughters  
The man from abroad says he's already bought her  
And now you look like a lover but you're only a tourist  
  
You're either talking or yawning  
You didn't listen to a thing you heard  
Don't start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg  
  
You get over  
You're worried by her body  
She's worryin' about her bodily odor  
You pull off  
The pull over  
You say that you love her when you really loathe her  
Serves you right now she wants you to feed her and clothe her  
  
You're either talking or yawning  
You didn't listen to a thing you heard  
Don't start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg  
  
They're smiling sweetly while they're looking daggers  
Kick you where it really matters  
Send all your friends to Coventry  
And look for your name in last night's obituaries  
  
If you've got the Deutschmarks  
If you've got the yen, then  
You get the shirt off her back and the clock off Big Ben  
Somebody's soft touch  
Struck all these bargains  
In the drinking clubs with the council men making  
Plans to put lead back in their pencils again  
  
You're either talking or yawning  
You didn't listen to a thing you heard  
Don't start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg
