And I'm a runner  
But you knew that  
When you lay down  
  
I'm a picture  
Of ugly stories  
I'm a killer  
And I'm a clown  
  
Step into the street by sundown  
Step into your last goodbye  
You're a target just by living  
Twenty dollars will make you die  
  
I wear lace  
And I wear black leather  
My hands are lightning up  
On my gun  
  
My shots are clean  
And my, my shots are final  
My shots are deadly  
And when it's done  
  
You're as stiff as my smoking barrel  
You're as dead as a desert night  
You're a notch  
And I'm a legend  
You're at peace  
And I must hide  
  
Tell where the hell I'm going  
Let my bones fall in the dust  
Can't you hear that ghost that's calling  
As my Colt begins to rust  
In the dust  
  
I'm a killer  
I'm a clown  
I'm a priest  
That's gone to town

I've seen that face before  
I know those eyes  
Unearthly wise  
I feel it more and more  
To look at you,  
Deja vu,  
Chills me to the core  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
But that only confused me  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
And that frankly amused me  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
  
Gradually  
I can see  
Things are getting clear  
That ageless face  
Satanic grace  
This sudden rush of fear  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
Now they got me believin'  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
So I'd better be leavin'  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
  
Here I am  
Door's been slammed  
They're gonna roast my hide  
Make me bleed  
'Til I plead  
For you to let me die  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
Now they got me believin'  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
God, I wish I'd believed them

Alice Cooper,Die For You,/a/alice+cooper/die+for+you_20005782.html,"A hundred numbers on my wall  
Some with names I sometimes call  
I drop a coin and watch it fall  
Tryin' to get connected to you  
  
A thousand hours all alone  
My softest pillow turns hard as stone  
This is the longest night on my own  
Lying here thinking of you  
  
Sometimes I shake my head  
And laugh to myself  
I'd like start again with somebody else  
I'm like a broken toy forgotten on the shelf  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, I could have been someone  
I could have been something  
It would have been nothing to die for you  
Baby, you're going to need me  
You'd better believe me  
It would have been easy to die for you  
  
A milloin memories flood my brain  
Drown my sorrow  
Kill my pain  
Wets my thirst for you again  
Just another night to get through  
  
All my neighbors scream for quite at my door  
Shattered glass and torn up photos thrown on the floor  
Well, I couldn't stand to see your pictures anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These cuts are deep but you plead innocent  
Are you hell or are you heaven-sent?  
You're much too cold to know how much  
You meant to me, yeah  
  
A billion tear drops fallen from my eyes  
But it's just a joke now  
And I'm laughing at your lies  
You made me hard as rock and now I realize

About a redneck boy down from Tupelo  
I got the slick black hair, I played a rock guitar

He ate his weight in country ham  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland

I had a lot of girls, yeah, I had a lot of guns  
When they found me dead, ow, the whole world was stunned  
Went to the pearly gates, said, ""I'm the hippest thing""  
And Peter said ""Well son, we already got ourselves a king""  
  
He lived on southern deep-fried spam,  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
He finished his short life sweaty and bloated and stoned  
(A-Hey-Hey)  
He ruled his domain and he died on the throne  
No ""Yes-Men"", no colonel, he went all alone...  
  
(Hey, man, that looks like me down there on the floor)  
  
I heard the devil cry real loud and clear  
""You were the big man, there, hejust a sideman here  
Well, I know your face, and I've heard your name  
Looks like heaven's loss, gonna be my gain""

As cold as ice  
Like some bathroom floor

And forgotten scenes

Escape from this deam

When are you coming home  
No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Love is sweet  
And bitter too  
The taste can leave cold  
You know I hate it  
But I cannot refuse to capture control  
  
How it seems  
There's no way out  
I guess I never knew  
Emptiness has left no doubt  
Now I want you  
  
Baby I miss you

Like my boots were full of glue

Hung me in the breeze  
At forty five degrees in the sky  
Suddenly I felt something  
Had me by the belt  
And in between my praying  
Swore I heard a stallion neighing  
Was the ghost of my horse  
And I cried, yes I cried

My dead pet returned to save my life  
That was the day

Got caught on territory  
Belonging to the Crutches  
In an alley in their clutches  
Looking kind of dismal that night  
Well the leader's name was Fats  
Swinging broken baseball bats  
Things got really frantic  
Starting jumping in their panic  
Hallucinating billions of rats  
Lots of rats

Someday they'll throw away the key

I'd have jumped out of bed with a scream  
  
I am the one who growls in your closet  
I am the one who lives under your bed

Get down, back where you started  
Get down, back into hell  
Your black soul, you know you're black hearted  
I smell your sulfurous smell  
  
All of my things that I play with in daylight  
You turn into monsters at night  
My toys were my friends  
Until you taught them all how to bite  
  
You showed me things little boys shouldn't see  
You scared me with visions of fire  
You danced on my bed  
With the flames on your head dancing higher  
  
I am the one who growls in your closet  
I am the one who lives under your bed

I don't want your reptile embrace  
I don't want to follow you down to your place  
I don't want to be a child of disgrace

at the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup  
Spewing, sweating blood demon breath out of my face

Come the night you're only what I want  
Come the night you could be my confidant  
  
Come the night you're only what I want  
Come the night you could be my confidant  
  
I see you on the street in company  
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me  
I'm living for the night we steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
I need you at the dimming of the day

I run away to a place in me  
To a faraway land  
  
When home seems so far from me  
Heaven's lights look dim  
It's just as far as my deepest heart  
Where my heart's Father lives  
  
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday  
If I will only listen to the words He has to say  
I'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in my face  
I will live, 'cause He will live in my place  
  
When life seems so hard to bear  
When shadows look real  
The circumstance is your Father's care  
Go by faith not what you feel  
  
If you have been running too  
Stop now in your tracks  
Turn again to the one in you  
Put your burden on His back  
  
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday  
If I will only listen to the words He has to say  
I'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in your face

Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
Still somethin' deep inside keeps tellin' me to make the sacrifice,  
And askin' me to walk the extra mile.  
I've walked it now to many times with freedom for the price.  
Too many times to fight back tears behind my smiles.  
  
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
I know I must seem quite unkind to wander off tonight  
And leave the moon up above to hold your gaze.  
It's only that my foolish heart is bound with foolish pride.  
Maybe some day I'll see the sunshine upon your face.  
  
Now I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.

And she looked into her crystal ball  
Said ""You're in love.""  
  
Said it could not be so,  
Not with all the girls I know.  
Said when the next one arrives  
Looking into her eyes.  
  
I left there in a hurry

The next thing I discovered  
The fortune teller told me lies  
  
So I ran back to that woman  
Mad as I could be  
Told her I didn't see nobody  
How she made a fool out of me

As if it came down from above  
And now the fortune teller  
And I fell in love

You can let go now  
It's not right for me  
To cling to you  
Somehow I just needed time  
From what was to be

Almost never came down  
Only to land  
Where no love is found  
And I'm no longer bound

Six feet underground

Beneath the waves so blue

Fly all night till day drew nigh  
Touch down upon a branch and  
Scan the crowd for you  
  
When I touch my feet on the land

Just have a little mercy on me  
Run away and hide  
  
When I sleep the angels sing  
But I cannot hear a thing  
Eyes close  
Dreaming of the better days gone by  
  
When I wake the trumpets play  
And I'm standing at the gates  
Fall down and joy  
I know my race has just been won  
  
When I was young my momma would say  
Well life is hard, but that's O.K.

Darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone  
He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights  
They remind him, of nights long ago,  
When his love was strong and his muscles hard, His whiskey throat was barley
marred,  
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to
his knees,  
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not
hold  
[Chorus:]  
On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay  
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away  
And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood,  
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his
women's love  
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger
and fear  
As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen
leaves  
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his
injured pride  
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not
hold

He heals my wounded spirit  
And he sets me on my feet  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
Sometimes your battle weary  
But the war's already won  
Keep your head and hold your shield high  
'Til your days of life are done  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive

Alison Krauss,That Kind Of Love,/a/alison+krauss/that+kind+of+love_20316764.html,"Who would sell their soul for love  
Or waste one tear on compromise?  
Should be easy enough  
To know a heartache in disguise  
But the heart rules the mind  
And the going gets rough  
Pride takes the fall  
When you find that kind of love  
  
I can't help feeling like a fool  
Since I lost that place inside  
Where my heart knew its way  
And my soul was ever wise  
Once innocence was lost  
There was not faith enough  
Still my heart held on  
When it found that kind of love  
  
Though beauty is rare enough  
Still we trust  
Somehow we'll find it there  
With no guarantee  
It seems to me  
At least it should be fair  
  
But if it's only tears and pain  
Isn't it still worth the cost  
Like some sweet saving grace  
Or a river we must cross  
If we don't understand  
What this life is made of  
We learn the truth  
When we find that kind of love  
Cause when innocence is lost  
There is not faith enough  
We learn the truth  
When we find that kind of love

And gave his life completely to bring a better day

Need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin  
When the lights are low, and when it's time to go,  
I need your love so bad.  
So give it up, and bring it on home to me.

Transcribed by sam carle  
  
Time and time again I've felt these wall's of plaster,  
Closing in,  
And more than once I've felt that lonely lonely feeling,  
Wondering why and where I've been,  
Just about the time, I think I can't hold on,  
You're always there to keep me hanging on and I say,  
  
I never knew how much a man needed a woman  
(no I never)  
I never knew how much a boy needed a girl  
(needed a girl)  
I never knew how much I needed you  
  
Day after day I join the rat race,  
Tryin' to make the most of it,  
I keep on falling down down the ladder,  
Still trying to stay on top of it,  
Just when I was sure,  
Nothing could get no better,  
Oh I realize,  
I still love you more than ever,  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Today I watch the sun set on the freeway,  
Strangled on the poison air,  
But miles beyond, on the other end,  
I know, you'll always be waiting there,  
Girl you treat me,  
With your kindest hand,  
And in my heart, in my mind,  
And I'm so glad  
  
[Chorus:]

But the spell of that pretty young girl is far too strong,  
Between her fine perfume and angel face,  
My whole world became another place.  
The dark side of her intelligence was so strong,  
Soon there'll be no difference in right or wrong.  
Next thing I know I had a key that unlocked her door.  
I could not wait to hear the siren song,  
The beginning of the end of my happy home.  
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, oooh, hooo,  
too blind in love, too blind to see.  
Heard them say the payback's double-fold,  
Just can't seem to remember who I bought and sold.  
I'll probably still be here when you come around next year,  
Trying to climb from this deep dark hole.  
I'll be damned if I just don't feel I'm growin' old.  
Sailing, sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo,  
Too blind in love, too blind to see.  
Cause she was eviler than evil, slippery like a fox,  
set me up with pain and woe and, I swear it won't seem to stop.  
If I could just remove her hook from deep from within my soul,  
Swear I'll leave and not come back, just let me out that door.

he who's master of the icy shots won't harm you till the evening  
we shall meet tomorrow night

Alphaville,Five Years,/a/alphaville/five+years_20006895.html,"Pushing through the market square  
So many mothers sighing  
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in  
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying  
Cried so much, his face was wet, then I knew, he was not lying  
  
I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies  
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and tv's  
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare  
I had to cram so many things to store, everything in there  
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people  
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people  
I never thought I'd need so many people  
  
A girl of my age went off her head, hit some tiny children  
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them  
A soldier with a broken arm  
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a cadillac  
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest  
And a queer threw up at the sight of that  
  
I think I saw you in an icecream parlour  
Drinking milkshakes cold and long  
Smiling and waving and looking so fine  
I don't think you knew you were in this song  
And it was cold and it raind, so I felt like an actor  
And I thought of ma and I wanted to get back there  
Your face, your race, the way that you talk  
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk  
  
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes, we've got five years, what a surprise  
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot, we've got five years, that's all
we've got  
We've got five years...

I forgive the angels who could never take me high,  
I forgive all my dreams that I couldn't really fly  
I forgive the thought that I couldn't stop thinking,

I forgive the promises that they've been broken, I forgive the curses that
they have been spoken  
I forgive all the prophets and the saints of the past, I forgive the stars

I forgive the joke that it didn't make me laugh, I forgive desire that I had
to starve  
I forgive all the love for the sake of love, I forgive all sakes for the fake

For the sake of love, for the sake of love  
For the sake of love

Alphaville,Forever Young,/a/alphaville/forever+young_20006842.html,"Let's start in style, let's dance for a while,  
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies.  
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst,  
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?  
  
Let us die young or let us live forever  
We don't have the power, but we never say never  
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip  
The music's for the sad man.  
  
Can you imagine when this race is won?  
Turn our golden faces into the sun,  
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune  
The music's played by the madman.  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever?  
Forever, and ever  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young  
Do you really want to live forever?  
Forever young.  
  
Some are like water, some are like the heat  
Some are a melody and some are the beat  
Sooner or later they all will be gone  
Why don't they stay young?  
  
It's so hard to get old without a cause  
I don't want to perish like a fading horse  
Youth's like diamonds in the sun,  
And diamonds are forever  
  
So many adventures couldn't happen today,  
So many songs we forgot to play  
So many dreams swinging out of the blue  
Oh let them come true  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever, and ever?  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever young?  
  
Forever young  
I want to be forever young  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever, and ever?  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever?

Alphaville,Giants,/a/alphaville/giants_20206860.html,"Be on your guard when you sit in the open places  
because I'm blessed with all the wonders of the sun  
when tigers, palmtrees, rattlesnakes unfold their graces  
that kind of magic you may get a sunburn from  
and there's no better way for us than our old sweet ways  
and angels burn to dust before the human race  
we're giants under a rainbow  
we're stranded east of eden  
Sometimes we're crying in the afterglow  
in a world of broken toys, how can we live without them  
freedom that is what you are always screaming  
it is a scream but more a nightmare than a laugh  
those without faith are liars even when they're dreaming  
I'd put my faith in god if he knew how to dance  
but there's no devil in the darkness, no demon in the skies  
nothing to be afraid of, cross my heart and hope to die  
freedom...  
Freedom...

And quietly say the words  
The words that you'd expect  
I wish I'd touched your face  
And you would hold my hand  
Then tears were on our guard  
And silence was our friend  
And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes  
The struggle and the strife and the black and white  
And all the letters that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memories to behold  
Without explanations  
To be told...  
I dreamt I had the time to listen what you'd say  
And what you'd say was true and we could start anew  
I saw u bachstage in that chair  
Dressed up in lies but oh so fair  
And then I took you by the hand and off we went  
And we just drank to quench our thirst  
That never dies and always burns  
Deep in the night out on the streets  
I'd like to kiss you too but it wouldn't do  
And all the poems that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memories to behold  
Without explanations  
To be told...  
And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes  
The struggle and the strife and the black and white  
And all the letters that we wrote

For nuggets of fleeting bliss  
C'mon, c'mon you can't escape  
The bleeding bullet of a kiss

It's shining in your eyes  
We're always going on and on  
Right from that day they start to shine  
It's a new situation  
The start of a game, you've already won the prize  
He's a lunatic dancer  
Who's not aware that he's skating on thin ice  
There's no turning back  
No time for regrets, you should've known better, though  
Another chance to fall in love  
Another chance to turn you on  
Another chance to turn you on  
Here comes that golden feeling  
It's shining in your eyes  
We're always going on and on  
Right from that day they start to shine

When I can hear the birds again  
I'm as helpless as can be  
Will you guard my little flame  
If we never meet again  
You shall always keep in mind  
That you were my guard tonight  
That you were my guard tonight

And it goes round and round for free  
We've made some gruesome inventions  
Yet we're mastered by those systems  
We're endangered danger, we're running out of fashion  
If we don't care for responsibility, hey-hey  
We're endangered danger, we're endangered danger  
We're the headlines today but all that we say is  
We're endangered danger  
Eric says that we're a lonely species  
That's why we're playing the fools  
But once we'll enter the aquarian age  
I sometimes catch him floating in his swimming-pool  
He says  
If we'd tune in to our brighter sides  
We'd feel like Jesus on the waters  
Cause we're sailors not soldiers  
So much more for this show  
Than a guest-appearance in the universe, here we go  
We're endangered danger, we're endangered danger  
We're the headlines today but all that we say is  
We're endangered danger
