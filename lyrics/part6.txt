you led me through the nights - and through the hardest fights  
we dreamt wed be the ones - and we would never lose  
you made me speechless - and fearless - yet it made you fearless too  
oh how we dreamt to be so fearless - no matter what they do

those unknown chaps without a slightest chance  
i know, all without faith are liars even when theyre dreaming

but if you give them up they stay - till someone else takes them away  
i met you in this hotel hall - oh nino, aint it hard

By the hour of the wolf in a midnight dream

Just start that brand new story

We need the ecstasy, the jealousy,  
The comedy of love  
Like the Cary Grants and Kellys once before  
Give me more tragedy, more harmony  
And fantasy, my dear  
And set it alight, just starting that satellite  
Set it alight

To once forbidden places  
We'll go for a while

It gave you a kiss  
In the middle of the crossroads  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
The heat of the sun  
Which is stored in the pavement  
Feels so fine  
  
Here stands the innocent  
And there it comes oh so wild

For a summer by the wall  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright

Heart on the sleeve of the constitution  
Sinking right into a mirror  
Leaving reflections on its surface  
Caught in a kind of radio-beacon  
That's sending out signals  
Transmitting them backwards

Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face,  
Do I still walk on the same structure?  
Hey, what do we know  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Watching your face thru' a peephole  
As I lean against the door  
Can't understand what you say  
But I think that you're calling my name  
Leaving the ones I loved is like  
Leaving the one they want me to be  
Making decisions  
In real-time-precision  
As millions of sailors  
In parallelworlds  
Hey, tell me it's true,  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face  
Do I still walk on the samestructure?

Made me sad to think it was dead

In the desert you can remember your name

Cause the desert had turned to sea  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings

And a perfect disguise above  
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground

A nightclub in the middle  
Tappin' time to my song  
Catch hell for leavin'  
They are always wrong  
Down here...  
As I walk through marble  
Finding my way in the night-light  
Two people sit and argue  
Someone inside here  
Will give them a ride clear  
I know a place where we both can go  
To set our hearts on fire  
I know the city's the only show  
Can I take you for a ride  
I can make you satisfied  
All 'n all it's worth your while  
Change that frown back to a smile  
Tonight

At the mouth of the sea (I've been lost for so long)

Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising

I'll take the chance this time to change my world (change my world)  
And break those ties that bind (ties that bind)  
Far from those people passing through my life  
Like ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Under the bridge I'll move to far off lands (far off lands)  
Maybe Australia or North African sands (North African sands)  
Complete my mission, hope you understand

Down from the meadow and onto the seashore  
Came the vast checkerboard kingdom of men  
Sun radiates gold infrarays  
Time to prepare for the fall  
Harvest the corn, watch for the storm  
Soon we will hear winter call  
Ice on the pond, won't stay too long  
Too thin to walk it today  
Ice on the pond, something went wrong  
Frost must be lost on the way  
Evening is falling  
The tree is a silhouette  
As seen by the teddy bear  
Watching his den  
Spring came so quickly  
That I did not see her  
Just turn around  
And she's coming again  
Wind chimes along, rising at dawn  
Seasons in circles too match  
Each comes along, singing his song  
Burying thoughts of the past

Is resting heavy on my head  
And the thoughtful words of help and hope  
Have all been nicely said  
But I'm still hurting, wondering if I'll ever be the one  
I think I am--I think I am.  
Then you gently re-remind me  
That You've made me from the first  
And the more I try to be the best  
The more I get the worst.  
And I realize the good in me is only there because of who  
You are, who You are.  
And all I ever have to be is what  
You've made me  
Any more or less would be a step out of Your plan  
As you daily recreate me help me always keep in mind  
That I only have to do what I can find  
And all I ever have to be  
All I have to be  
All I ever have to be is what You've made me

And I cannot explain the way You came to love me

Amy Grant,O Little Town,/a/amy+grant/o+little+town_20007591.html,"O little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep  
The silent stars go by  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
  
How silently, how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of His heaven  
We hear the Christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us  
Our Lord Emmanuel  
  
No ear may hear his coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls will receive Him  
Still the dear Christ enters in.

I yield my flickering torch to thee  
My heart restores its borrowed ray  
That in thy sunshines glow its day  
May brighter, fairer be

I cannot close my heart to thee  
I trace the rainbow through the rain

It was a kingdom made of sand  
But now you've blown it all away  
I can't believe that I can say that I'm glad.

With a power that superceded my control  
And if that truth could pierce my heart I wouldn't wander from the start
Trying desperately to make it on my own.

Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
It's all that we all need more of year in, year out, I'm left with no doubt  
The greatest of all gifts is love

Andy Williams,Days Of Wine And Roses,/a/andy+williams/days+of+wine+roses_20192723.html,"The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play  
Through a meadow land toward a closing door  
A door marked ""nevermore"" that wasn't there before  
  
The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories  
Of the golden smile that introduced me to  
The days of wine and roses and you  
  
(The lonely night discloses) Just a passing breeze filled with memories  
Of the golden smile that introduced me to  
The days of wine and roses and you-oo-oo.

Andy Williams,Falling In Love With Love,/a/andy+williams/falling+in+love+with+love_20520085.html,"Falling in love with love is falling for make believe  
Falling in love with love is playing the fool  
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy  
Learning to trust is just for children in school  
  
I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full  
I was unwise with eyes unable to see  
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting  
But love fell out with me  
  
Oh, I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full  
I was unwise with eyes unable to see  
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting  
But love fell out with me

Andy Williams,I Will Wait For You,/a/andy+williams/i+will+wait+for+you_20520079.html,"If it takes forever I will wait for you  
For a thousand summers I will wait for you  
Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you  
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms  
  
Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go  
Every day remember how I love you so  
In your heart believe what in my heart I know  
That forevermore I'll wait for you  
  
The clock will tick away the hours one by one  
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done  
The time when you return and find me here and run  
Straight to my waiting arms  
  
If it takes forever I will wait for you  
For a thousand summers I will wait for you  
Till you're here beside me, till I'm touching you  
And forevermore sharing your love

Andy Williams,If I Could Only Go Back Again,/a/andy+williams/if+i+could+only+go+back+again_20826204.html,"If I could only go back again  
To the places where I have I have been  
Feeling love as we did then  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
Crystal waters of yesterday  
Golden rainbows you washed away  
Lonely clouds that can only say  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
To live in your arms again  
To love like we did then  
To run free as the wind forever  
  
Silver wings of eternity  
Take me back like the child to see  
Faces lost in the memories  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
To live in your arms again  
To love as we did then  
To run free as the wind forever, run

Andy Williams,I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,/a/andy+williams/im+so+lonesome+i+could+cry_20832801.html,"Hear the lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is winding low  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
I've never seen a night so long  
Where time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
To hide its face and cry  
  
The silence of a falling star  
Lights up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Andy Williams,It's A Most Unusual Day,/a/andy+williams/its+a+most+unusual+day_20321717.html,"It's a most unusual day  
Feel like throwing my worries away  
As an old native-born Californian would say  
It's a most unusual day  
There's a most unusual sky  
Not a sign of a cloud passing by  
And if I want to sing, throw my heart in the ring  
It's a most unusual day  
There are people meeting people  
There is sunshine everywhere  
There are people greeting people  
And a feeling of Spring in the air  
It's a most unusual time  
I keep feeling my temperature climb  
If my heart won't behave in the usual way  
Well, there's only one thing to say  
It's a most unusual day  
There are people meeting people  
There is sunshine everywhere  
There are people greeting people  
And a feeling of Spring in the air  
I keep feeling my temperature climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb  
Till there is only one thing to say  
It's a most, most, most, most, most unusual, most unusual  
Most unusual da-ay-ay  
Most unusual da-ay

Andy Williams,Love Song Of Kalua,/a/andy+williams/love+song+of+kalua_20998262.html,"This is the night of love  
The shining hour of Kalua  
Her song is in the air  
Her lips are waiting there  
Who will be Kalua's only love?  
  
Who will her lover be?  
Who will her lover be?  
  
Before the night is old  
My arms will hold Kalua  
And where the trandewinds blow  
Soft and low  
  
Our love will blossom bright  
In the night  
And stars will sing above  
The love song of Kalua

Andy Williams,Love Story,/a/andy+williams/love+story_20250204.html,"Where do I begin  
To tell the story  
Of how great a love can be  
The sweet love story  
That is older than the sea  
The simple truth about the love she brings to me  
Where do I start  
  
With her first hello  
She gave new meaning  
To this empty world of mine  
There'll never be  
Another love, another time  
She came into my life  
And made the living fine  
She fills my heart  
  
She fills my heart  
With very special things  
With angel songs  
With wild imaginings  
She fills my soul  
With so much love  
That anywhere I go  
I'm never lonely  
With her along who could be lonely  
I reach for her hand  
It's always there  
  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now  
But this much I can say  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now  
But this much I can say  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there

May the Lord always watch over you  
And may all of your hopes turn to wishes  
And may all of your wishes come true  
  
May each day in the month be a good day  
May you make friends with each one you meet  
And may all of your daydreams be mem'ries  
And may all of your mem'ries be sweet  
  
The weeks turn to months and the months into years  
There'll be sadness and joy, there'll be laughter and tears  
But one thing I pray to heaven above  
May each of your days be a day full of love  
  
May each day in the year be a good day  
May each dawn find you happy and gay  
And may all of your days be as lovely  
As the one you shared with me today  
  
May each day of your life be a good day  
And good night.
