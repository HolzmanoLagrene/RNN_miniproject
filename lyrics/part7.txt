Andy Williams,So Rare,/a/andy+williams/so+rare_20007916.html,"What is so rare as a day in June?  
'Till now we have never been told  
The old question's answered by one that is new  
What is so rare, dear, as you?  
  
So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair  
Sweet as a breath of air  
Fresh with the morning dew  
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne  
Orchids in cellophane  
Couldn't compare to you  
You are perfection you're my idea  
Of angels singing the Ave Maria  
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you  
With every beat of the heart that I give you  
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share  
Caring the way we care  
Ours is a love so rare  
  
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air  
Charming and debonaire  
Those are the words for you  
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare  
That ""one in a million"" air  
In everything you do  
You have that something, that certain manner  
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""  
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender  
And in that love scene I gladly surrender  
So rare, to have a future like yours to share  
Sweetheart the way we care

Andy Williams,Still Under The Weather,/a/andy+williams/still+under+the+weather_20824394.html,"My first lesson  
In losin' love was you  
Learnin' to live with your memory  
Was lesson number two  
And I can't lie  
Baby I still cry sometimes  
But I've come a long way  
Towards gettin' you out of my mind  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I still miss the shelter  
Of your lovin' arms  
But what I thought would kill me  
Has just made me strong  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
Sometimes your memory  
Still gets the best of me  
But that lonely ache in my heart  
Ain't as bad as it used to be  
And sometimes the way that I'm feelin'  
Inside doesn't show  
But I know  
I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I still miss the shelter  
Of your lovin' arms  
But what I thought would kill me  
Has just made me strong  
I'm still under the weather

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then  
But I can't remember where or when  
Some things that happened for the first time  
Seem to be happening again  
  
And so it seems that we have met before  
And laughed before, and loved before  
But who knows where or when

snow is glistening

Gone away is the bluebird  
here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
as we go along  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say: Are you married?  
we'll say: No man  
But you can do the job  
when you're in town  
  
Later on  
we'll conspire  
as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
the plans that we've made  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
and pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
until the all the kids knock him down  
  
When it snows  
ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
the Eskimo way  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland

Hey, What happened to the butterflies  
Guess they didn't count at that stop sign  
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light  
Hey, right when I think that we found it  
Well that's when we start turnin' around  
You're saying baby don't worry  
But we're still going the wrong way baby  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And you decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
They say only fools fall in love  
Well they must've been talking about us  
And sometimes I feel like, I've been here before  
Ah  
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right  
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight  
Honey I know  
Yeah, we can find our way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want

By Arlo Guthrie  
Come all you old time cowboys  
And listen to my song  
Please do not grow weary  
I'll not detain you long  
Concerning some wild cowboys  
Who did agree to go  
And spend the summer pleasant  
On the range of the buffalo.  
Well I found myself in Griffin  
In eighteen eighty-three  
When a man by the name of Creagho  
Come a'walkin' up to me  
Sayin ""How do you do young fella  
And how'd you like to go  
And spend the summer pleasant  
On the range of the buffalo"".  
Well me being out of work right then  
To that drover I did say  
""My goin' out on the buffalo range  
Depends upon the pay  
But if you pay good wages,  
Transportation to and fro  
I think I might go with you  
On the range of the Buffalo"".  
Well yes I pay good wages  
And transportation too  
If you'll agree to work for me  
Until the season's through  
But if you do get homesick  
And you try and run away  
You'll starve to death out on the trail  
And you'll also lose your pay  
Well with all the flatterin' talkin'  
He signed up quite a train  
Some ten or twelve in number  
Of able bodied men  
And our trip it was a pleasant one  
Through all New Mexico  
Until we crossed Pease River  
On the range of the buffalo  
It was there our pleasures ended  
And our troubles all begun  
A lightnin' storm come up on us  
And made the cattle run  
We got full of the stickers  
On the cactus that did grow  
And the outlaws waited to pick us off  
In the hills of Mexico  
Well the working season ended  
But the drover would not pay  
He said ""You spent your money boys  
You're all in debt to me"".  
But the cowboys never put much stock  
In a thing like a bankrupt law  
So we left the bastard's bones to bleach  
On the range of the buffalo.

Take down the wire on the boundary  
Take back the words that were spoken in anger

It ain't right, it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
I hope they play this song of mine  
On the jukebox for a dime  
Then if you leave 'cause something's wrong  
You'll hear your cowboy sing an old time song  
Oh babe, I love you so  
This here is the only thing I know  
It ain't right and it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song

Arlo Guthrie,Drowning Man,/a/arlo+guthrie/drowning+man_20189587.html,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
I remember when I met you  
Underneath the evening sky  
Now it seems I could forget you  
Rescue me, I'm bound to die  
All the promises we made there  
With no words to understand  
And though I've tried I've come up empty  
Heart of stone, drowning man  
CHORUS:  
I'm going down for the third time  
And I need a helping hand  
The rooster crows and I'm sinking  
Heart of stone, drowning man  
Where are you, my dear companion  
How much longer must you be  
I'm all alone out on the ocean  
When will you come and rescue me  
It's too late for new beginnings  
In this world I've left behind  
There is nothing left worth keeping  
Not a thing to change my mind  
CHORUS  
How far down the road to glory  
Must we go without a sign  
Caught out on these stormy waters  
How can you treat me so unkind  
Did you know from the beginning  
That I'd dig this lousy hole  
Oh, don't leave me here abandoned  
In this dark night of the soul

That I wrote one afternoon after everyone had gone  
And I know that this won't mean a lot to you  
You've got better things to do but for me I'll just go on  
Old dog is lying in the middle of the road  
He don't do nothing 'cause he don't want to  
And I think I'm gonna like that hound  
'Cause the more he sits around, the less I want to do too  
Gonna sit right here and watch the world roll by  
Till we both just up and die watching clouds and eating flies  
Don't want to bother no one, don't want nothing here to change  
A dusty road is all we've ever dreamed of  
And I think I'm gonna love this life  
Maybe someday take a wife  
She can join us if she wants to  
Ain't nobody gonna tell what to do  
If a car comes we just move  
And we both move real smooth  
Like old dog is moving must be something in the air  
Some bitch is coming up the road now  
And I think I'm gonna like that hound  
'Cause the more he gets around, the more I want to do too

Every hand in the land  
Shakes along with me  
It don't seem that I can dream  
Like I used to dream  
Maybe that somebody is shaking me  
If I fell I could tell  
It may be that somebody is making me  
Dream that you're forever  
Gone away from me  
Every toe that I know  
Step away with me  
I can't seem to get where  
I want to be  
Maybe it's my own foot  
That keeps tripping me  
Trip trap - flip flap  
It must come to wherever from it comes  
Through to me  
I can't walk to where  
My own dreams talk to me  
Every face in this place  
Take your eyes away  
Blink if you think that  
There's another way  
Maybe it's my own eyes  
That don't see the way  
The time is blind  
It may come to pass  
That I will lose my mind  
I can't live without the love I left behind  
I can't live without the love I left behind

Arlo Guthrie,Gates Of Eden,/a/arlo+guthrie/gates+of+eden_20209380.html,"Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides  
Upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun though it's glow is waxed in black  
All except beneath the trees of Eden  
The lamp post stands with folded arms its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Through its shadow's metal badge  
All in all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
The savage soldier sticks his head in the sand and then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf but still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
The time rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks, side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden  
Relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
The motorcycle 'Black Madonna', two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey, pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
The kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what's not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
The foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine  
As friends and others, strangers from their fates try to resign  
Leaving men holy and totally free to do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar  
Safe from all the wind and snow  
  
I know the police cause you trouble  
They cause trouble everywhere  
But when you die and go to heaven  
You won't find no policemen there  
  
I know your clothes are torn and ragged  
And your hair is turning grey  
Lift your head and smile at trouble  
You'll find happiness some day

I dreamed the world had all agreed  
To put an end to war  
I dreamed I saw a mighty room  
Filled with women and men  
And the paper they were signing said  
They'd never fight again  
And when the paper was all signed  
And a million copies made  
They all joined hands and bowed their heads  
And grateful pray'rs were prayed  
And the people in the streets below  
Were dancing 'round and 'round  
While swords and guns and uniforms  
Were scattered on the ground  
Last night I had the strangest dream  
I'd never dreamed before  
I dreamed the world had all agreed  
To put an end to war.

In all my dreams, I am roaming once more  
Back to my home on the old river shore  
I am sad and weary far away from home  
Miss the Mississippi and you dear  
Days are dark and dreary everywhere I roam  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always along and blue, so blue  
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Memories are bringing happy days of yore  
Miss the Mississippi and you dear  
Mocking birds are singing 'round the cabin door  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always alone and blue  
Longing form my homeland, muddy water shore  
Miss the Mississippi and you

Arlo Guthrie,Mystic Journey,/a/arlo+guthrie/the+mystic+journey_20268382.html,"Words and music by James Rider  
  
Just me and a friend roamin' around  
Him a magician and I was a clown  
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day  
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way  
  
Crossed over the border to a mystical land  
Sort of unexpected didn't quite understand  
On a razor's edge on a grain of sand  
Onward we wandered to the gates of oblivion  
  
On a roll of the dice we headed out west  
Where the sage and and the spice attracted us  
Shadows fell down like a dark groping hand  
Saw the teeth of the wolves and the blood of the lambs  
  
On a turn of the cards I lightened my load  
Throwing off fear for the weakness it holds  
On target and calm the vision was clear  
Beyond the mirage I took for granted was here  
  
On a flip of the coins we rode the coast  
Tryin' to make the most of every situation  
That we witnessed near at hand  
On a drifter's crusade all over the land  
  
Could it be in the stars in the passing of cars  
At a table in the bar in a turn of the cards  
In a change of your mind in the passing of time  
In a ribbon of rhyme just down the line  
  
Just me and a friend roamin' around  
Him a magician I was a clown  
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day  
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way

And now and then I don't feel lonely  
Now and then and only in my mind  
  
I want to go outside today go away, I think I'll stay  
Now and then I talk with you  
And now and then you turn me on  
Now and then and when I don't feel blue  
  
Maybe I could tell you now that I really love you  
Pleased to understand that you are there, in the air  
Now and then you turn me on  
Now and then you must be gone  
Now and then I said  
Say so long, now and forever then

Arlo Guthrie,Oklahoma Hills,/a/arlo+guthrie/oklahoma+hills_20227701.html,"Many a month has come and gone  
Since I've wandered from my home  
In those Oklahoma hills  
Where I was born  
  
Many a page of my life has turned  
Many lessons I have learned  
And I feel like in those hills  
Where I belong  
  
Way down yonder in the Indian nation  
Ridin' my pony on the reservation  
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born  
  
Way down yonder in the Indian nation  
A cowboy's life is my occupation  
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born  
  
But as I sit here today  
Many mile's I am away  
From the place I rode my pony  
Through the draw  
  
Where the oak and black-jack trees  
Kiss the playful prairie breeze  
And I feel back in those hills  
Where I belong  
  
Now as I turn life a page  
To the land of the great Osage  
In those Oklahoma hills  
Where I was born  
  
Where the black oil rolls and flows  
And the snow white cotton grows  
And I feel like in those hills  
Where I belong

Living now here but for fortune  
Placed by fate's mysterious schemes  
Who'd believe that we're the ones asked  
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
Arise sweet destiny, time runs short  
All of your patience has heard their retort  
Hear us now for alone we can't seem  
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
Can you hear the words being whispered  
All along the American stream  
Tyrants freed the just are imprisoned  
Try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
Ah but perhaps too much is being asked of too few  
You and your children with nothing to do  
Hear us now for alone we can't seem  
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams

Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ears  
Turn, turn, turn again  
Juliet prison for ninety-nine years

A crash on the highway threw a car into a field

There were four people killed and he was at the wheel

Turn, turn, turn again  
But the witness who saw it, he left little doubt  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
He may, he may have a sentence to server  
Turn, turn, turn again

Too late, too late, for his case it is sealed  
Turn, turn, turn again  
A sentence, it is passed and it can not be repealed  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
But he ain't no criminal and his crime it is none  
Turn, turn, turn again  
And what happened to him could have happened to anyone  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
At that the judge jumped forward and his face it did freeze  
Turn, turn, turn again  
Sayin', ?Would you kindly leave my office now, please?  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
I squinted my eyes and I stood up slow  
Turn, turn, turn again  
With no other choice except for me to go  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
I walked down the hall and I heard his door slam  
Turn, turn, turn again  
I walked down the stairs but I did not understand  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
And I played my guitar through the night and through the day  
Turn, turn, turn again  
But the only tune that my guitar would play  
Was oh how cruel, the wind and the rain

Arlo Guthrie,Power Of Love,/a/arlo+guthrie/power+of+love_20300205.html,"by T-Bone Burnett  
The power of love can make a blind man see  
Can bring a man to his knees  
  
The power of love can make a sultan grieve  
Can make a skeptic believe  
  
[CHORUS:  
The power of love is south of south  
And scorches out all the doubt  
  
The power of love is the name of names  
And burns away all the pain  
  
The power of love can make a gangster cry  
Can make a loser try  
  
The power of love can make a strong man weak  
Can make a bigot meek  
  
[CHORUS]  
The power of love can make a coward brave  
Can make a hero afraid  
  
The power of love can make a miser give  
Can make a dead man live

Arlo Guthrie,Prologue,/a/arlo+guthrie/prologue_20296398.html,"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
In the event of my demise  
Be sure to include this statement  
When you are bent on closing my eyes  
Thinking about what my life meant  
Alone on a hill back in '65  
Things looked a lot like changing  
Singing our songs that we harmonized  
Dreaming of worlds rearranging  
And I don't know why I'm singing tonight  
Maybe it's time someone told you  
Just because you say you've seen the light  
Doesn't mean nobody sold you  
I can remember all of your smiles  
During the demonstrations  
Taking on what seemed like the whole world  
Igniting the hearts of our nations  
And together we sang our victory songs  
Though we were worlds apart  
Every thing then has now passed away  
Except for the love in my heart  
Sitting at home on computerized beds  
Tryine to come to conclusions  
Seeing reflections from rose-colored heads  
Ignoring the states of illusion  
Drunk in a world of material wealth  
No one can notice you falling  
Fantastic flights once good tor your health  
Now make you deaf to your calling  
And all alone the prophet groans  
With words as yet unseen  
Who'll be awake when the master returns  
Who will be lost in their dreams  
So in the event of my demise  
8e sure to include this statement  
Only the words of love kept alive  
Are worthy of not being wasted

And I was not far from home  
Sunlight glancing on the water  
Life and death are all my own  
Yet I was never alone  
Life for all my sons and daughters  
Golden sparkles in the foam  
And I was not far from home  
Sailing down this winding highway  
Travelers from near and far  
And I was never alone  
Exploring all the little byways  
Sighting all the distant stars

Chorus  
  
This song is about the time that I was ridin' my motorcycle.  
Going down a mountain road, at 150 miles an hour, playin'  
My guitar. On one side of the mountain road there was a  
Mountain, and on the other side there was nothin' - there was  
A cliff in the air.  
  
Now, when you're going down a mountain road at I50 miles  
An hour you gotta be very careful, especially if you're playin'  
A guitar. Especially if that guitar is an acoustic guitar.  
Because if it's an acoustic guitar, the wind pressure is greater  
On the box side than on the neck side, because there's  
More guitar on the box side. I wasn't payin' attention..  
  
Luckily I didn't go into the mountain - I went over the cliff.  
I was goin' at 150 miles an hour sideways and 500 feet down  
At the same time.  
  
I knew it was the end. I looked down, I said ''Wow! Some  
Trip"". I thought it... Well I knew it was... I knew it was my last  
Trip, and in my last remaining seconds in world, I decided  
To write one last farewell song to the world.  
  
Put a new ink cartridge in my pen. Took out a piece of paper.  
I sat back and I thought awhile. Then I started writin':  
I don't want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorsickle  
And I don't want a tickle  
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorsickle  
  
And I don't want to die  
Just want to ride on my motorcy... Cle. ""  
  
I knew that, it wasn't the best song l ever wrote, but I didn't  
Have time to change it. I was comin' down mighty fast.  
  
But as you all know, and as fate would have it, I didn't die. I  
Landed on the top of a police car. And he died. I drove away  
On the road that he was on. I came into town at a screamin'  
175 miles an hour, playin' the motorcycle song.  
  
I came into town, I jumped off my bike, the bike went around  
The corner by itself, went up on the stand by itself, turned  
Itself off.  
  
I walked over to my friend. He was standin' there eatin'  
Pickles. I said ""Hi, what's happenin'?"" He looked at me in the  
Eye and said ""Nothin'"".  
  
You gotta sing it with that kind of enthusiasm. Like you just  
Squashed a cop...

Arlo Guthrie,The Pause Of Mr. Claus,/a/arlo+guthrie/the+pause+of+mr+claus_20292956.html,"This next song we're going to dedicate to a great American  
Organization. Tonight I'd like to dedicate this to our boys  
In the FBI.  
  
Well, wait a minute. It's hard to be an FBI man. I mean, first  
Of all, being an FBI man, you have to be over 40 years old.  
And the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the  
Organization to be that much of a bastard. It's true. You just  
Can't join, you know. It needs an atmosphere where your  
Natural bastardness can grow and develop and take a  
Meaningful shape in today's complex society.  
  
But that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI. I  
Mean, the job that they have to do is a drag. I mean, they have  
To follow people around, you know. That's part of their job.  
Follow me around.  
  
I'm out on the highway and I'm drivin' down the road and I  
Run out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They  
Gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you  
Know.  
  
I go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether  
They should stick with the car or follow me. Suppose I don't  
Come back and they're stayin' with the car.  
  
Or if I fly on the airplanes, I could fly half fare because I'm 12  
To 22. And they gotta pay the full fare. But the thing is that  
When you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane  
First, so that they know how many seats are left over for the  
Half fare kids. Right? And sometimes there aren't any seats  
Left over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn't mean that  
You have to go.  
  
Suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can't  
Get on. Then he gets off then you can get on. What's he gonna  
Do?  
  
Well, it's a drag for him. But that

When I come home at night  
Why you always start a fight?  
Now, babe I want you to know  
You left your motor runnin' slow  
I got off and got on a faster line  
Got me a baby that's got some dough  
When you gotta go, you gotta go  
Gonna leave you and ease  
This troubled mind of mine  
There's no need to talk to you  
'Cause you know that we are through  
I can find a better place to spend my time  
Now if I stay out late  
You know I'm swingin' on another gate  
Gonna leave you and ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  
Now baby I want you to know  
You left your motor runnin' slow  
I got off and got on a faster line  
Got me a baby that's got some sense  
Gonna leave you to ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  
There's no need to talk to you  
'Cause you know that we are through  
I can find a better place to spend my time  
Now if I stay out late  
You know I'm swingin' on another gate  
Gonna leave you and ease this  
Troubled mind of mine

Arlo Guthrie,Ukulele Lady,/a/arlo+guthrie/ukulele+lady_20518598.html,"I saw the splendor of the moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
There's something tender in the moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
  
And all the beaches are filled with peaches  
Who bring their ukes along  
And in the glimmer of the moonlight  
They love to sing this song  
  
1:  
If you like Ukulele Lady  
Ukulele Lady like a'you  
If you like to linger where it's shady  
Ukulele Lady linger too  
If you kiss Ukulele Lady  
While you promise ever to be true  
And she sees another Ukulele  
Lady foolin' 'round with you  
  
2:  
Maybe she'll sigh (an awful lot)  
Maybe she'll cry (and maybe not)  
Maybe she'll find somebody else  
By and by  
To sing to when it's cool and shady  
Where the tricky wicky wacky woo  
If you like Ukulele Lady  
Ukulele Lady like a'you  
  
She used to sing to me by moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
Fond memories cling to me by moonlight  
Although I'm far away  
  
Some day I'm going, where eyes are glowing  
And lips are made to kiss  
To see somebody in the moonlight  
And hear the song I miss

And it's nice to hear a fiddle by a fiddle playin' man  
  
Here's another song for Uncle Jeff Guthrie  
Written on the road by the light of the moon  
Thinkin' 'bout fiddlin' somewhere up in Michigan  
I hope that I can make it back to Colorado soon  
  
Well, my daddy had a fiddle, and he laid it on his son  
Sayin', ""Son, play the fiddle like your fiddlin' folks done.""  
Well, it's hard to learn to fiddle  
When you're fiddlin' on the run  
But fiddlin' is fiddlin', and fiddlin' is fun

Truth is you've been waiting so long  
You're ripe and so insane  
Can the tentacles of your mind stop the pain  
  
How long will you sit there wondering  
What's happening to your heart  
Can't you fell the love surround you - That's a start  
  
Chorus:  
I'll take to the road in a little while  
Under cover of night  
You come or you stay  
Whatever seems right  
  
I ain't looking for friends or lovers  
Ain't looking for a pot of gold  
Had it all when I was younger - It got old  
  
Who will leave this world of sorrow  
Who will die to all the fears  
Kowning I'll be gone tommorow - Gone for years  
  
Chorus  
  
Somewhere the sun's just rising  
And the road comes in to view  
There's a wanderer freed from dying - Could be you  
  
Who will pay the price for freedom  
Learn the disciplines of the road  
Many tried but few succeed - So I'm told

Just to read what's on the bulletin board  
When you go back and try and claim your space  
Some other sucker come and stole your place

I hope the people in the government  
Tell us how we're gonna pay the rent  
How we're gonna get enough to eat  
No that the workin' man is obsolete

Won't be long before they're down here too  
And they can be a part of this here mob  
Workin' nine to five to find a job

Arlo Guthrie,Utah Carroll,/a/arlo+guthrie/utah+carroll_20314424.html,"Arranged and adapted by Arlo Guthrie  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And I'll tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll, partner  
And his last ride on the trail  
In a grave without a headstone  
Without a date or name  
My partner lies there silent  
In the land from which I came  
Long ago we rode together  
We'd ridden side by side  
I loved him like a brother  
And I wept when Utah died  
While riding up one morning  
And our work was almost done  
The cattle quickly started  
On a wild and maddening run  
The boss's little daughter  
Who was riding on that side  
Rushed in to stop the stampede  
It was there my partner died  
Lenore upon her pony  
Tried to turn the cattle right  
But her blanket slipped beneath her  
And she caught and held on tight  
When we all saw that red blanket  
Each cowboy held his breath  
For should her pony fail her  
None could save the girl from death  
When the cattle saw the blanket  
Almost dragging on the ground  
They were maddened in a moment  
And they charged with deafening sound  
The girl soon saw her danger  
And she turned her pony's face  
And bending in her saddle  
Tried the blanket to replace  
Just then she lost her balance  
In the front of that wild tide  
Carroll's voice controlled the round up  
""Lie still, Lenore"" he cried  
And then close up beside her  
Came Utah riding fast  
But little did the poor boy know  
The ride would be his last  
Full often from the saddle  
He had caught the trailing rope  
To pick her up at full speed  
Was now his only hope  
He swung low from his saddle  
To take her to his arm  
We thought that he'd succeeded  
That the girl was safe from harm  
But such a strain upon his saddle  
Had ne'er been put before  
And the cinches gave beneath him  
And he fell beside Lenore  
When the girl fell from her saddle  
She had dragged the blanket down  
It lay there close beside them  
Where they lay upon the ground  
Utah took the blanket  
And to Lenore he said  
""Lie still"" and quickly running  
Waved the red thing o'er his head  
He turned the maddened cattle  
From Lenore, his little friend  
And as the mighty herd rushed toward him  
He turned to met his end  
And as the herd came on him  
His weapon quickly drew  
He was bound to die defended  
As all brave cowboys do  
The weapon flashed like lightning  
And it sounded loud and clear  
As the cattle rushed and killed him  
He dropped the leading steer  
When I broke through that wide circle  
To where poor Utah lay  
With a thousand wounds and bruises  
His life blood ebbed away  
I knelt down close beside him  
And I knew that all was o'er  
As I heard him faintly whisper  
""Good-bye, my sweet Lenore""  
Next morning at the churchyard  
I heard the preacher say  
""Don't think our kind friend Utah  
Was lost on that great day  
He was a much-loved cowboy  
And not afraid to die  
And we'll meet him at the round up  
On the plains beyond the sky""  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And I'll tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll, partner  
And his last ride on the trail

Arlo Guthrie,Victor Jara,/a/arlo+guthrie/victor+jara_20332274.html,"Words by Adrian Mitchell, music by Arlo Guthrie  
Victor Jara of Chile  
Lived like a shooting star  
He fought for the people of Chile  
With his songs and his guitar  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Victor Jara was a peasant  
He worked from a few years old  
He sat upon his father's plow  
And watched the earth unfold  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Now when the neighbors had a wedding  
Or one of their children died  
His mother sang all night for them  
With Victor by her side  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He grew up to be a fighter  
Against the people's wrongs  
He listened to their grief and joy  
And turned them into songs  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He sang about the copper miners  
And those who worked the land  
He sang about the factory workers  
And they knew he was their man  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He campaigned for Allende  
Working night and day  
He sang ""Take hold of your brothers hand  
You know the future begins today""  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Then the generals seized Chile  
They arrested Victor then  
They caged him in a stadium  
With five-thousand frightened men  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Victor stood in the stadium  
His voice was brave and strong  
And he sang for his fellow prisoners  
Till the guards cut short his song  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
They broke the bones in both his hands  
They beat him on the head  
They tore him with electric shocks  
And then they shot him dead  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Repeat first verse

In a strange and foreign land  
A soldier packs his memories  
As he leaves Afghanistan  
And back home, they don't know too much  
There's just no way to tell  
I guess you had to be there  
For to know that war was hell  
And there won't be any victory parades  
For those that's coming back  
They'll fly them in at midnight  
And unload the body sacks  
And the living will be walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seems to care these days  
When a soldier makes it home  
They'll say it wasn't easy  
Just another job, well done  
As the government in Kabul falls  
To the sounds of rebel guns  
And the faces of the comrades  
Being blown out of the sky  
Leaves you bitter with the feeling  
That they didn't have to die  
And there won't be any victory parades  
For those that's coming back  
They'll fly them in at midnight  
And unload the body sacks  
And the living will be walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seems to care these days  
When a soldier makes it home  
Halfway around the world tonight  
In a strange and foreign land  
A soldier unpacks memories  
That he saved from Vietnam  
Back home they didn't know too much  
There was just no way to tell  
I guess you had to be there  
For to know that war was hell  
And there wasn't any big parades  
For those that made it back  
They flew them in at midnight  
And unloaded all the sacks  
And the living were left walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seemed to care back then  
When a soldier made it home  
The night is coming quickly  
And the stars are on their way  
As I stare into the evening  
Looking for the words to say  
That I saw the lonely soldier  
Just a boy that's far from home  
And I saw that I was just like him  
While upon this earth I roam  
And there may not be any big parades  
If I ever make it back  
As I come home under cover  
Through a world that can't keep track  
Of the heroes who have fallen  
Let alone the ones who won't  
Which is why nobody seems to care  
When a soldier makes it home

And the breeze will cease to be breathin'

The hour that the ship comes in  
And the sea will split and the ships will hit  
And the sands on the shoreline will be shakin?  
And the tide will pound and the wind will sound  
And the mornin? will be a breakin?  
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path  
And the seagulls, they'll be a smilin?  
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused  
Will not be understood as they're spoken  
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night  
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean  
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts  
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline  
And the sun will respect every face on the deck  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold  
For your weary toes to be a touchin'  
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again  
That the whole wide world is watchin'  
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes  
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'  
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real  
The hour that the ship comes in  
Then they'll raise their hands sayin', we'll meet all your demands  
But we'll shout from the bow, your days are numbered  
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned there in the tide  
And like Goliath they'll be conquered

Never see a dime for selling out to the man.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
We say we met in church, but we're a product to market research.  
We sing about sex, to little girls who shouldn't think about sex yet.  
It's not like they listen, it's not like they care.  
'Cause when we sweat our bodies glisten.  
We like the color blue. (blue, blue)

Arrogant Worms,Carrot Juice Is Murder,/a/arrogant+worms/carrot+juice+is+murder_20009361.html,"Listen up brothers and sisters come hear my desperate tale  
I speak of our friends of nature trapped in the dirt like a jail  
Vegetables live in oppression, served on our tables each night  
This killing of veggies is madness, I say we take up the fight  
Salads are only for murderers, coleslaw's a fascist regime  
Don't think that they don't have feelings, just cause a radish can't scream  
  
[Chorus]  
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream)  
Watching their skins being peeled (having their insides revealed)  
Grated and steamed with no mercy (burning off calories)  
How do you think that feels (bet it hurts really bad)  
Carrot juice constitutes murder (and that's a real crime)  
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (let my vegetables go)  
It's time to stop all this gardening (it's dirty as hell)  
Let's call a spade a spade (is a spade is a spade is a spade)  
  
I saw a man eating celery, so I beat him black and blue  
If he ever touches a sprout again, I'll bite him clean in two  
I'm a political prisoner, trapped in a windowless cage  
Cause I stopped the slaughter of turnips by killing five men in a rage  
I told the judge when he sentenced me, ""This is my finest hour,  
I'd kill those farmers again just to save one more cauliflower""  
  
[Chorus]  
How low as people do we dare to stoop,  
Making young broccolis bleed in the soup?  
Untie your beans, uncage your tomatoes  
Let potted plants free, don't mash that potato!  
Oh spare the spud! Eat a cow instead!  
  
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream)  
Watching their skins being peeled (fates in the stir-fry are sealed)  
Grated and steamed with no mercy (you fat gourmet slob)  
How do you think that feels? (leave them out in the field)  
Carrot juice constitutes murder (V8's genocide)  
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (yes, your composts are graves)  
It's time to stop all this gardening (take up macrame)  
Let's call a spade a spade  
(is a spade, is a spade, is a spade, is a spade......)

And most of these stupid new houses don't even have chimneys  
I use to be jolly, now I'm depressed  
Had a twinkle in my eye, now I've got a bullet proof vest

They keep shooting at me like I'm some sort of big fat red criminal  
Got the Christmas blues, I'm starting to see  
That I gotta be some sort of loser to get paid in milk and cookies  
I've grown to hate kids, especially their mail  
Always asking me for stuff, well guess what I don't care, oh  
Maybe I'm getting cranky as I get old  
'cause I feel like giving them all a big lump of coal

You might say I gave to much  
Until my family was broke and we had no place to live  
That's why, Christmas Sucks

Had to the Santa what to bring  
A train, a bike, a pony and a great big pile of cash  
And please don't get my sister anything  
But the shopping mall Santa has been drinking  
His nose is red from years of drinking scotch  
He probably won't remember what's on my Christmas list  
This Father Christmas sucks  
Chorus:  
Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks  
Getting stuff is much for fun, you gotta look out for number one  
Christmas Sucks  
Christmas became worse as years went by  
It was the most dreaded time of year  
My parents got me clothes that just weren't cool  
When all I want is money to buy beer  
There was a girl at church who I was sweet on  
So in the Christmas play I was the ox  
I really think she liked me til I stepped on Baby Jesus  
Even for our savious Christmas Sucks

Now that I am thirty-wight years old  
The only things I get are ties and socks  
My kids are never happy with what's under the tree

Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
Before my expiration, I need resuscitation  
Mouth to mouth  
  
She throws water on my face, slaps my cheek  
Helps me back on my stool  
She's a waitress here, but in the night  
She's a student at nursing school  
She comes again with a smile and the bill  
I pick it up and choke again  
She's charged me for my lunch and for the medical procedure  
  
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
For my lasting endurance, I'll need medical insurance  
For my bill  
For me to get some peace, I'll need a tracheotomy  
And an airbag

Arrogant Worms,History Is Made By Stupid People,/a/arrogant+worms/history+is+made+by+stupid+people_20518507.html,"Scott became famous for freezing to death in Antartica.  
Columbus made history thinking some island was India.  
General Custer's a national hero for not knowing when to run.  
All these men are famous, and they're also very dumb.  
  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.

Nobility are famous for no reason.  
Marie Antoinette enjoyed her cake.  
She cause a Revolution when she would not share.  
And her husband lost his head for that mistake.  
  
The Hindenberg was a giant zeppelin.  
Her makers made a minor oversight.  
Before they filled it up with explosive gas  
They should have fixed the no smoking light.  
  
'Cause!

Tally-Ho! Tally-Ho!  
Our king and country's honor we will save.  
Tally-Ho! Tally-Ho!  
We're marching into history and the grave.  
  
So, if your son or daughter seem too lazy,  
Sitting there watching mad T. V.  
Just remember you should be quite grateful  
At least they're not making history.  
  
Ahhh!  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.  
If you wanna place in the history books,  
Then do something dumb before you die.  
Do something dumb before you die  
Do something dumb before you die!!

Arrogant Worms,Kill The Dog Next Door,/a/arrogant+worms/kill+the+dog+next+door_20009321.html,"I once was a happy man of sound and stable mind  
Then my neighbour bought a dog  
He put a ribbon on it's head to make it cute  
But it still looked like a chihuahua  
He had me over to watch it sit and beg  
It bit my knee, and made love to my leg  
Now it barks all the night and all of the day  
Whenever it's not peeing on my lawn  
I didn't get to sleep last night till very late  
The stupid dog barked and grrrr'd  
I got up late for work and ran to catch the bus  
But I slipped on a turd  
I was certain it wasn't one of mine  
That that dog had crossed over the line  
I wanted to exterminate it and all it's kind  
From my lovely little suburb  
I'm gonna kill the dog next door  
Ain't gonna bark anymore  
'Cause this is Judgment Day  
And the little runt has got to pay  
No more turds on my lawn  
That stupid mutt will soon be gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog  
I see the little monster in my garden  
So I grab an axe and off I go  
And I try my best to get it  
All I do is sever my big toe  
My neighbour comes outside to call me  
He says his dog and me should just be friends  
He puts his little pet in my forgiving hands  
Then it starts to bite  
So I strangle it with all my might  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
I'm gonna kill the dog next door (kill the dog next door)  
Ain't gonna bark anymore  
'Cause this is Judgment Day  
And the little runt has got to pay  
No more turds on my lawn (doo-doos on my lawn)  
That stupid mutt will soon be gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog  
Now the stupid mutt's in doggy heaven  
I strangled it to death and now I'm free  
But my trouble ain't quite over  
My neighbour called the cops on me  
I end up at the police station  
Where I am told that I must pay  
A 300 dollar fine  
Wow, what a good value  
I think I'll kill my neighbour too!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
I'm gonna kill the guy next door (kill the guy next door)  
Won't call the cops anymore  
I never liked him anyway  
300 isn't much to pay  
There are turds on my lawn (doo-doos on my lawn)  
They must be his, his dog is gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill
