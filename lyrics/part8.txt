Arrogant Worms,My Voice Is Changing,/a/arrogant+worms/my+voice+is+changing_20009325.html,"Last night when I went to bed  
With tangled hair upon my head  
In every way I really was a kid  
It happened without warning  
When I woke up in the morning  
I can't tell you just what happened but it did  
  
I grew six inches in one day  
It's painful when it goes that way  
And now my skinny body's really achin'  
And my skin just exploded  
With an inch of oil it's loaded  
It's so greasy you could fry a pound of bacon  
  
My voice is changing  
Out of thin air  
And body parts that once were smooth  
Are growing bits of hair  
My voice is changing  
What does it mean?  
I guess I'll be a real man  
Before I turn 13  
  
I buy two pairs of jeans a week  
I'm such a tall and awkward geek  
I fall down when I try to play a grounder  
At dinner every night I eat  
A giant heaping plate of meat  
Then go out with my friends for quarter pounders  
  
And weird emotions come alive  
My hormones are in overdrive  
I've turned into a girl-watching creature  
And all my friends their marks are shot  
But they don't care because they're hot  
For Mrs. Smith the mathematics teacher  
  
My voice is changing  
I hate to hear it crack  
I pray to God I won't inherit  
Dad's hairy back  
My voice is changing  
When will it end?  
And when will mom stop kissing me  
In front of all my friends?  
  
Pretty soon I bet I'll  
Be right into heavy metal  
But my parents say at least it isn't rap  
I'll start wearing stupid clothes  
And threaten that I'll pierce my nose  
And tell my parents all they like is crap  
  
The first girl that I ever kiss  
Will be the one and who could miss  
Our love forever written in the stars?  
But I don't think our love will last  
Unless the four years go by fast  
Till I can use the backseat of the car  
  
My voice is changing  
Out of thin air  
And body parts that once were smooth  
Are growing bits of hair  
My voice is changing  
What does it mean?  
I guess I'll be a real man  
Before I turn 13  
  
My voice is changing  
I hate to hear it crack  
I pray to God I won't inherit  
Dad's hairy back  
My voice is changing  
When will it end?  
And when will mom stop kissing me  
In front of all my friends?  
  
Cha-cha-cha!

It works for a month then the spark goes missing

That you play alot and then it gets lame  
Then a new one comes out that's better but the same

Our love is like a surgical procedure  
It's painful and invasive, your insurance won't cover  
And when it's done you walk funny forever

Our love is like a Meatloaf song  
It has its moments but it's way too long

Arrogant Worms,"Oh God, I'm Santa Claus",/a/arrogant+worms/oh+god+im+santa+claus_20009339.html,"Open my eyes, what a beautiful day  
Just the type that makes me want to say hooray  
I'm still a little fuzzy-headed from my sleep  
Into my brain reality seeps  
Look all around me, can't believe what I see  
These little short people are surrounding me  
I've got a white beard, a suit made of red  
My soul becomes filled with a keen sense of dread  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
Hop out of bed, kick an elf in the chest  
What an awful way to awake from a rest  
""Santa, oh, Santa,"" the little gnomes cheer  
""You shouldn't be nasty at this time of year!""  
""What do you mean?"" I say in a rage  
""And what are you doing with those big burlap bags?""  
The elves they do roar, ""Why their full of toys  
For you to deliver to the good girls and boys. ""  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
Resigned to my fate, I load up the sleigh  
Harness the reindeer and get under way  
It's nippy up here in the cool arctic sky  
Good thing I remembered that bottle of rye  
Flying over rooftops, throwing out toys  
Hopefully crushing those good girls and boys  
Like a bad dream, I pray for release  
Please let this hellish existence be ceased!  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
From this nightmare I finally awake  
My brain is on fire, my hands they do shake  
But wait, they're not hands, they're cute little paws  
I'm the Easter Bunny, I'm not Santa Claus!  
  
Oh God, I'm the Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I 'm Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I'm Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I'm Easter Bunny

Arrogant Worms,Particle Board,/a/arrogant+worms/particle+board_20297966.html,"Well my baby came at me with a 2x4  
So I fought her off with sandpaper  
It was 60 grit, it was really rough  
And it made a lot of sawdust  
But we patched things up with love and glue  
We went to the church and said ""I do""  
Our honeymoon was at a hardware store  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Particle Board, it ain't got no grain  
Unless you paint it with a darkwood stain  
Particle Board, it doesn't take no brains to know that  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Well I heard the train come rolling by  
With cattle on board, so we decided  
We should drop everything and hop that train  
And take a one-way trip to the slaughterhouse  
Well we stared at the cattle as they took the walk  
To meet the man who worked the saw  
We stared at the blood and the guts and the gore  
It looked an awful lot like particle board  
Particle Board, it ain't got no grain  
Unless you paint it with a darkwood stain  
Particle Board, it doesn't take no brains to know that  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
We made love on a flat bed truck  
She worried about getting splinters in her butt  
I said don't think about those problems when we rut  
The deck's made of particle board  
Ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Particle board, you could make a dresser  
Or a shelf or a hutch or an ottoman  
You could leave it like it is or paint it up  
It's still gonna be made of particle board  
Particle board, it's useful stuff  
It's stronger than glue, it's better than fluff  
It sounds like a simile and that's enough  
To say that our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Particle Board!

I burned my toast and spilled my coffee  
On my best shirt. So I had to change and then  
I'm late for work. So I rush into the meeting  
Where they are discussing what my future in the corporation is  
And I don't really give a damn  
But I don't have another job  
And so I lie and say  
  
I'm proud to be a banker

To contribute to my RRSP for this tax year

From the automatic teller. It told me  
That I couldn't 'cause I just had 10  
But that can't be 'cause I just got paid on Friday  
So I go down to the bank, wait an hour in the lineup  
And I'm talking to the teller  
She says ""Wait I'll get your last month's statement""  
She comes back in 7 hours  
Says I've got some interest charges and a cheque from Uncle Bill  
That bounced and so they'll have to charge me 40 bucks for that  
And for the box I never opened and I don't have overdraft protection  
And I think I'll die before I pay off all that I owe and I don't even  
Own a car

It's the scariest sight I've ever seen  
The most chilling visual

It's really really huge  
It's a fat man in a Speedo  
I'm walking on a beach in a tropical isle  
Hoping to enjoy the sand and surf  
When I see a mound of baby-oiled flesh  
Rolling and a broiling in the foam  
The only thing that's holding this  
Explosion of Caucasian is  
A tiny red synthetic coloured thread  
I try to sink it in the sand  
And entomb it in a castle but  
It always manages to break free  
The fat man in a Speedo  
I'm having nightmares  
I'm scared to open my eyes  
I try to free myself  
By going to the buffet  
But there he is  
He even eats in his Speedo  
I take up a collection at the bar the next day  
And everybody gives to the cause  
To rent a helicopter that will take this whale  
To Cuba and free the horizon from his bulk  
We have a celebration  
In one of his indentations  
And throw a bowl of jello in the air  
We think we've escaped and our scenery is clear  
But in comes a plane from Germany  
Thirty fat German men wearing Speedos!

There once was a time when the country was wide. A time before cars and planes
and minivans. So, to move things from one place to the other, the railroad was
built. But it just didn't up and build itself. Nope, it was built by the
railroad men. And among these men was a man among men among men among men
among men among men, a man as tall as the sky and as wide as the land. A man
who could lay track faster than anyone else could run. A man with the strength
of ten men. His name was John Henry, and I'm not gonna sing about him. No, I'm
gonna sing about a lesser know figure, one who doesn't deserve a song. A man
as lazy as a thousand men. A man who could barely raise his own body off the
ground. A man who was barely a man at all. His name was Mike McCormick.  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man

Only thing he worked on was his tan

And everyone around thought he was a jerk  
He'd take long breaks and say his back was hurt

Mike: No.  
Mike's dad: Oh.  
His arms were like twigs and his legs were like straws  
His hands were like a baby's bum they were so soft  
He'd wheeze and moan and whine and cough  
Then go home and take a little nap  
He never got fired 'cause he was the boss' son  
He just hung around and bothered everyone  
Never drove a spike, not a single one

Mike's dad: You don't understand! You see, it's gonna cost us all our jobs.
You, Mike McCormick, gotta prove 'em wrong!

Men like me, that's how the west was won

For on the trail I am the king  
On doors I knock and on bells I ring  
Always sure that I will get the sale

I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally

The door swings wide and I sense my prey  
Ready to fall victim to my pitch  
I tell him all about the plan  
With all of its inherent benefits  
If you lose an arm it's a thousand bucks  
Lose both of them and get twice as much  
And if you should die, well then, bless your luck  
You'll just be raking in the cash

A lonely man out on the land  
Where the wind can blow so cold  
I ride into the setting sun  
With the knowledge of a job well done  
But I can't rest until everyone  
Has become properly insured

With stupid hats and plastic plates  
The fact that you were able to make  
Another trip around the sun  
  
And the whole clan gathers round  
And gifts and laughter do abound  
And we let out a joyful sound  
And sing that stupid song  
  
Happy birthday!  
Now you're one year older!  
Happy birthday!  
Your life still isn't over!  
Happy birthday!  
You did not accomplish much  
But you didn't die this year  
I guess that's good enough  
  
So let's drink to your fading health  
And hope you don't remind yourself  
The chance of finding fame and wealth  
Decrease with every year  
  
Does it feel like you're doing laps  
And eating food and taking naps  
And hoping that someday perhaps  
Your life will hold some cheer  
  
Happy birthday!  
What have you done that matters?  
Happy birthday!  
You're starting to get fatter  
Happy birthday!  
It's downhill from now on  
Try not to remind yourself  
Your best years are all gone  
  
If cryogenics were all free  
Then you could live like Walt Disney  
And live for all eternity  
Inside a block of ice  
  
But instead your time is set  
This is the only life you get  
And though it hasn't ended yet  
Sometimes you wish it might  
  
Happy birthday!  
You wish you had more money  
Happy birthday!  
Your life's so sad it's funny  
Happy birthday!  
How much more can you take?  
But your friends are hungry  
So just cut the stupid cake  
  
Happy birthday!  
Happy birthday!  
Happy birthday, dear...

I'm not saying you have to but it's an interesting theory  
Darwin said we all evolve from monkeys

If it does I wanna devolve back to a monkey  
I wanna be a monkey that's for sure  
I wanna be a monkey like Curious George  
I would sit around all day just eating bananas  
I might be naked or just wear pyjamas  
And make my money appearing in hilarious movies  
Monkey see, monkey do  
That would be my excuse  
It's not my fault, I'm just a monkey who can see  
I wanna be a monkey, that'd be nice  
I wanna be a monkey, eating other monkey's lice  
When they say it's so easy that a monkey could do it  
I'd be more than happy to prove it  
Then you'd know for sure if it was easy or not  
And if you wanna see the home of Michael Jackson  
I could provide some simian distraction  
Cuz we all know monkeys are Michael's second biggest weakness  
I wanna be a monkey yes I do  
I wanna be a monkey and fling my poo  
I wanna be a monkey

What a thrilla to be a gorilla  
It would rock to be a macaque  
I wanna be a monkey

I really don't look good in red and my stupid hat flies off my head in every

thrifty

Arrogant Worms,The War Of 1812,/a/arrogant+worms/the+war+of+1812_20518504.html,"Come back proud canadian's,  
To before you had TV.  
No hockey night in canada,  
There was no CBC.  
  
In 1812 madison was mad,  
He was the president you know.  
Well he thought he'd tell the british where they ought to go.  
He thought he'd invade canada,  
He thought that he was tough.  
Instead we went to washington,  
And burned down all his stuff.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned.  
And we're the ones that did it,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
While the president ran and cried,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
And things were very historical,  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.  
  
Those hilbilies from kentucky,  
Dressed in green and red.  
Left home to fight in canada,  
But they returned home dead.  
It's the only war the yankies lost except for veitnam.  
And also the alomo and the bay of ham.  
The looser was america,  
The winner was ourselfs.  
So join right in and gloat about the war of 1812.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned.  
And we're the ones that did it,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
While the president ran and cried,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
And things were very historical,  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.  
  
In 1812 we were just sitting around,  
Minding our own business,  
Putting crops into the ground.  
We heard the soilders coming,  
And we didn't like that sound.  
So we took a boat to washington and burned it to the ground.  
  
Oh we fired our guns but the yankies kept on a coming,  
There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and the yankies started running,  
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.  
They ran through the snow,  
And they ran through the forest,  
They ran through the bushes where the beavers wouldn't go,  
They ran so fast they forgot to take they're culture,  
Back to america, and gulf and mexico.  
  
So if you go to washington,  
It's building clean and nice,  
Bring a pack of matches,  
And we'll burn the white house twice.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned,  
But the americans wont admit it.  
It burned, burned, burned...  
It burned and burned and burned  
It burned, burned, burned  
I bet that made them mad.  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.

My brother and my sister, they both have their Ph.D.

But I am the most famous, I'm a TV weather guy

H e always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke  
Thinks a meteorologist knows what falls from the sky  
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
  
They said that I'm not qualified to be on the TV  
Don't know Celsius from Fahrenheit so I just say degrees  
I just read the temperatures and make up a bunch of lies  
And end up being right more than the guy on channel five  
  
He smiles at the camera and tells a little joke  
He always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke  
Thinks cloud are made from cotton that have blown up to the sky  
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
  
On Saturdays I must be out of bed by five A.M.  
Put on a ton of make-up and then stare at the camera lens  
Greeting all the viewers with a ""Hi-hi-hip-hello!""  
'Cause it's the day I have to host a kiddie cartoon show  
  
He smiles at the camera then to his puppet sock  
He raves about the crayon drawings of the family dog  
Did a promo at the shopping mall and made the children cry  
He's a lousy clown but a good TV weather guy  
  
They said that I'm not cute enough to be an anchorman  
Not tough enough for sports and for the arts I was too bland  
But I know that some day I will reach my TV goal  
When I guest star on Baywatch or 90210  
  
'Til then I'll smile at the camera and tell a little joke  
He always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke  
He wonders why big storms are always named for other guys  
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
He's got a steady income as a TV weather guy!

The earth is moving  
I feel it under my feet  
And I'm still proving  
  
That I can stand my ground  
And my feet are there  
Having washed my hair  
To be lost before you are found  
Don't mean you're losing  
  
I am falling down  
Try and stop me  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
You can watch me  
Fall right on my face  
It's an uphill human race  
And I, I am falling down  
  
Someday I'll live in a house  
Etc, etc, etc  
But you know that's not for now  
For now I'm falling down, down, down  
Down, down, down  
Down, down, down  
Yea, yeah, yeah  
  
I am falling down

Avril Lavigne,Fly,/a/avril+lavigne/fly_21097614.html,"[Verse 1]  
There's a light inside of all of us  
It's never hiding, you just have to light it  
It's the one thing that you gotta trust  
It's like a diamond, you just have to find it  
So if you ever feel like giving up  
Yeah, just remember that  
  
[Chorus]  
We were all meant to fly  
Spread your wings across the universe  
It's your time to  
It's your time to shine  
There's a light inside of all of us  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly  
Your time to fly  
  
[Verse 2]  
A little help is all it ever takes  
Somebody has to tell you it's worth fighting  
A single step becomes a leap of faith  
That's when you realize you started flying  
So don't you ever say you're giving up  
No, there's no looking back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Just reach up  
Don't give up  
Until you've touched the sky  
Just reach up  
Don't give up  
Until you've realized

Spread your wings across the universe

Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly, fly  
It's you time to shine, shine  
Soon you'll find that

They're all lookin at those who are provokin,  
Little things that worry me are about to end

You're only foolish, that didn't go to my head  
As little as you are you want left alone  
Confusing as a dog that hates bones

Think of me as a distraction  
Stoppping your work stopping your attraction  
Little as I know.  
I'm a girl who likes who no one would ever of dream of me thinking,

Whatever caused me to stop the moment

You're the one thing I got right  
The only one I let inside  
Now I can breathe 'cause you're here with me  
And if I let you down I'll turn it all around

Avril Lavigne,I Won't Be Home For Christmas,/a/avril+lavigne/i+wont+be+home+for+christmas_20517908.html,"Outside the carolers start to sing  
I can't descibe the joy they bring  
'Cause joy is something they don't bring me  
  
My boifriend is by my side  
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice  
Their whiny voices get irritating  
It's Christmas time again  
  
So I stand with a dead smile on my face  
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste  
Oh God, I hate these Satan's helpers  
  
And then I guess I must have snapped  
Because I grabbed the baseball bat  
And made them all run for shelter  
  
It's Christmas time again  
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand  
All year  
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer  
You people scare me  
Please stay away from my home  
If you don't wanna get beat down  
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone  
  
Well, I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve  
Cause the cops came and arrested me  
They had an unfair advantage  
And even though the jail didn't have a tree  
Christmas came a night early  
Cause a guy named bubba unwrapped my package  
  
It's Christmas time again  
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand  
All year  
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer  
You people scare me  
Please stay away from my home  
If you don't wanna get beat down  
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone  
  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas

I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas

How can you say you meant anything different  
To anyone standing alone on the street  
With a cigarette on the first night we met  
  
Look to the past and remember your smile  
And maybe tonight I can breathe for awhile  
I'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep  
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

So perfect  
You're not for real

Evrybody's friends  
And in time  
You know that this will end  
  
But you're not thinking of how it should be done  
So maybe you're losing your mind

And I can think of a thousand places  
That I know I could be  
But it's just one of those days  
When I'm hopeless and useless but happy  
  
Do you ever work out  
How it could be done  
I ain't got a doubt  
I know this is the one  
And if you feel  
Like nothing will change  
Stay for real  
Reality's not out of your range

Another milestone  
Or maybe not so  
But still you can turn  
You can burn  
Or just go  
But it all  
Fills up

So perfect  
You're not for real

Strike up the band and make the fire flies dance,  
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me.  
  
Kiss me down by the broken tree house,  
Swing me upon it's hanging tire.  
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat,  
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map.

Can I make it any more obvious  
He was a punk  
  
She did ballet  
What more can I say  
He wanted her

But all of her friends  
Stuck up their nose  
They had a problem with his baggy clothes  
  
He was a skater boy  
She said see you later boy  
He wasn't good enough for her  
She had a pretty face  
But her head was up in space  
She needed to come back down to earth  
  
Five years from now  
She sits at home  
Feeding the baby she's all alone  
She turns on t.v  
  
Guess who she sees  
Skater boy rockin' up MTV  
She calls up her friends  
They already know  
  
And they've all got  
Tickets to see his show  
She tags along  
Stands in the crowd  
Looks up at the man that she turned down  
  
He was a skater boy

Too bad that you couldn't see,  
See the man that boy could be  
There is more that meets the eye  
I see the soul that is inside  
  
He's just a boy  
And I'm just a girl  
Can I make it any more obvious  
We are in love  
Haven't you heard  
How we rock each others world  
  
I'm with the skater boy  
I said see you later boy  
I'll be back stage after the show  
I'll be at the studio  
Singing the song we wrote

Tension grows,  
As the whistle blows,  
And the puck goes down the ice.  
The goalie jumps,  
And the players bump,  
And the fans all go insane.  
Someone roars:  
""Bobby Scores!""  
At the good old hockey game!

Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!  
  
Second Period.  
Players dash,  
With skates a-flash,  
The home team trails behind.  
But they grab the puck,  
And go bursting up,  
And they're down across the line.  
They storm the crease,  
Like bumblebees,  
They travel like a burning flame.  
See them slide the puck inside,  
It's a one one hockey game!

Face off down the rink,  
And the Stanley Cup,  
Is all filled up,  
For the champs who win the drink!  
Now the final flick,  
Of a hockey stick,  
And a one gigantic scream:  
""THE PUCK IS IN! THE HOME TEAM WINS!""  
At the good old hockey game  
  
(chorus- repeat 3 times)  
Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!

Avril Lavigne,The Other Guy,/a/avril+lavigne/the+other+guy_20517876.html,"[Verse:]  
I know I'll never have him  
But I'm there when you're not over his friend  
I listen when you come to me  
But 'cause of who he is you don't have the time to see  
  
I really feel the way you feel  
Just 'cause it's him don't mean it's not real  
Your always sayin' your love's true  
I listen but I can't say the same for you  
  
[Bridge:]  
What I offer's unreturned  
You don't have time to see me burn  
You've so far failed to see  
How much you're affecting me  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you think of him  
I'm thinkin' of the other guy  
I'm in love to  
He's constantly on my mind  
If you weren't shared by blood  
Then would you have the time  
I don't get to choose  
Who I dream of at night  
You tell me how you feel  
I feel the same way with the other guy  
So bad it's not real  
You can't make me cover it up, you know I really try  
You can see by my skin  
I shiver and shake and I follow him with my eyes  
I'm nervous and I know it's a sin  
But seein' him drives me wild inside  
  
[Verse 3:]  
If it was another  
Maybe not your brother  
Would it be ok to let him drive me wild?  
But then lookin' back  
You've always turned your back  
Would it be ok to listen to my smile?  
  
[Verse 4]  
Your convinced  
He's so unperfect  
But I'm convinced  
That it's worth it  
  
I listen to you goin on and on  
Bout how you and that boy got it on  
You don't have time to listen to me  
I'm in love but you can't see  
I don't have opinions you just talk  
But with me you tell me I'm stupid to feel what I feel  
I can't run away you only let me walk  
Come on now girl, you ain't bein' real

Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends  
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour  
I remember that it's the first time that I saw her there  
  
She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing  
I'm kinda nervous, cause I think all her friends hate me  
She's the one, she'll always be there  
She took my hand and I made it I swear  
  
Chorus  
  
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  
She said ""what?"" and I told her that I didn't know  
She's so cool, better sneak me through her window  
Everything's better when she's around  
I Can't wait until her parents go out of town  
Cause I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  
  
When we said we were gonna move to Las Vegas  
I remember the look her mother gave us  
17 without a purpose or direction  
We don't owe anyone a fuckin explanation  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Black and white picture of her on my wall  
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting  
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance  
Because she kept me waiting

With the girl at the rock show

Pulling the puzzles apart

You've only got yourself to blame

On my shoulders and back  
I used to lie inside my room  
Wondering where I am at  
  
I felt a chill running through my veins  
And wondered, would I be saved?  
I felt the ice building in my soul  
Would it melt away?  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
  
I used to worry my life away  
Counting every dime  
Shutting out the ones I loved  
Never finding the time  
  
And then one day I was overcome  
By loneliness and despair  
And deep inside I thought I heard  
""Lean on me, I'm here""  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
I pulled the burden from off my back  
And tossed it into the wind  
And stretched my arms toward the sky  
And let my life begin  
  
And like a tree, I have measured up  
Best when I've been cut down  
And like a tree, I can touch the sky  
With my feet on the ground  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me

The choir to sing  
A white dress that gets to keep the kinda hold on thing  
But no one needs to know

But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now.  
  
Gonna have a little girl

A little engy we call Leroy  
But no one needs to know

You can live your life all on your own

That we play this game?

Let me tell you what I see through my eyes  
Apathy is all around and on the rise  
We channel so much energy through our greed  
Which leads us to become absolved of those in need  
Lemme tell you  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
It's funny how we took a prayer out of schools  
After the 9-11 scare that's all we do  
We compromise our liberties for security  
We can become so self in dosed that we can't see  
Lemme tell you  
  
Money can't buy lives

Remember your brothers and sisters

Don't throw in the towel  
Let's overcome the test for now  
Together (together) we last, divided we fall  
Love will conquer all  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you (Sunny days for you)

Came across a vision that caught my eye  
  
There was a lady standing  
Right there beside a well, and I heard her whisper  
What you wish for you can have  
  
Then the vision went away  
I thought that I had lost her  
The girl I had been waiting for  
I can't believe I just saw her  
She is the finest thing, I ever could imagine  
Now I want her next to me, cause I want, cause I want more

Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll love forever  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
  
She is a gentle flower, she is the sun and rain and  
She could be the reason for my joy and my pain  
The first thing I see each morning, the last thing I see at night  
You know if I could have all that  
That's all I wish for in my life  
  
Why did she have to go  
What do I say to find her  
This girl is the only one  
I cannot deny her  
She's making love to my mind  
And I can't forget this feeling  
It's her voice that's calling  
It's her voice I need

I, I, know we're gonna take it  
In a world like this where people fall apart  
In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart  
In a world like this, I've got you
