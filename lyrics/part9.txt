You gave me a smile that I could never forget

Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

But still I have to say I would do it all again  
Just want you to know  
  
All the doors are closing I'm tryin' to move ahead  
And deep inside I wish it's me instead  
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

Baby we will discover that we can be more than lovers  
I give you what you need

You will know what I need

Ooohh  
Yeah yeah  
  
Once there was a time love was just a myth  
It just wasn't for real, didn't exist  
Til the day you came into my life  
You forced me to think twice  
I didn't have too much, no I wasn't rich  
Gave me belief someday I'd be more than this  
That's why until this day I'm still your man  
Cause you made me understand that  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair  
The two of us but no one there  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is  
The only thing that keeps me sane  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
You're my secret place where I can be myself  
You connect with me like nobody else  
Even though our circumstances changed  
Our love still remains  
Meet me on the ground, still you help me fly  
You taught me to be patient, I taught you to rely  
So no matter what tomorrow brings  
We got the simple things cause (noooo)

The way your lips seem to curve

Riding her bike through alphabet city  
  
She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side  
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise  
She said ""what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?""  
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl

Right alongside the rich and famous  
Get in elevators, press emergency stop  
And make love on the floor until the camera made us  
  
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire  
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,

And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons,  
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is,  
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things,  
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it,  
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it  
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it,  
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me.  
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be,  
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty,  
There has to be some type of change for this day and age,  
We gotta rearrange and flip the page,  
Living encaged like animals and cannibals,  
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five,  
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive  
Peace of mind's so hard to find.  
  
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,  
Throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now  
  
Problems, complications and accusations  
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces  
A war is taking place.  
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace  
Is increasing the height of your spirituality.  
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions  
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living.  
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,  
But will we live to see the dawn.  
  
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be  
Is a living hell torturing our minds.  
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,  
And the love in our hearts will shine.  
  
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other  
Whatever happened to protecting each other  
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure,  
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever.  
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,  
Family values are contradicted.  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough.  
  
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,  
Throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about

But the only trouble is I can't get her out of my mind  
When I close my eyes at night  
Who's gonna save me  
Now she's gone (she's gone)  
The trouble is there's a part of me  
That still can't let go of her memory (I just can't)  
And now I know what it is (yes I do)  
And now I know what it is  
'Cause love is what the trouble is  
The trouble  
Love, love is what the trouble is

Just one gift for me.  
  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas  
'Cause I'm with you!  
  
Wooh!  
  
The ornaments are rocking,  
Somebody stole my stocking.  
I think I threw out all my gift cards  
With the recycling.  
  
The Christmas lights are tangled,  
The mistletoe got mangled,  
And even though my nerves are jangled,  
I'm good with everything!  
  
'Cause now I know the reason  
It's the season of good cheer.  
I'd even eat the fruit cake,  
It's the same one as last year!  
  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas  
'Cause I'm with you!  
  
Hey! Hey! Hey!  
Put your hands up in the air!  
Ho! Ho! Ho!  
Santa, can you feel it?  
Here we go!  
Spread the magic everywhere.  
Hey! Ho! Everybody shout out loud!  
  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas  
'Cause I'm with you! (Hey! Hey! Hey!)  
'Cause I'm with you! (Ho! Ho! Ho!)  
'Cause I'm with you! (Here we go!)

The average unmarried female  
Basic'lly insecure  
Due to some long frustration  
May react  
With psychosomatic symptoms  
Difficult to endure  
Affecting the upper respiratory tract  
In other words,  
Just from waiting around  
For that little band of gold  
A person can develop a cold  
You can spray her wherever you figure  
The streptococci lurk  
You can give her a shot  
For whatever she's got  
But it just won't work  
If she's tired of getting the fish-eye  
From the hotel clerk  
A person  
Can develop a cold  
The female remaining single  
Just in the legal sense  
Shows a neurotic tendency  
See note:  
Note: Chronic organic syndromes  
Toxic and hypertense  
Involving the eye,  
The ear and the nose and throat  
In other words,  
Just from worrying  
Whether the wedding is on or off,  
A person  
Can develop a cough  
You can feed her all day  
With the Vitamin A  
And the Bromo Fizz  
But the medicine never  
Gets anywhere near  
Where the trouble is  
If she's getting a kind  
Of name for herself  
And the name ain't ""his""  
A person  
Can develop a cough  
And further more  
Just from stalling  
And stalling and stalling  
The wedding trip  
A person  
Can develop La grippe  
When they get on a train  
For Niag'ra  
And she can hear church bells chime  
The compartment is air conditioned  
And the mood sublime  
Then they get off at Saratoga  
For the fourteenth time  
A person  
Can develop La grippe  
La grippe, La post nasal drip  
With the wheezes  
And the sneezes  
And a sinus that's really a pip!  
For a lack of community property  
And a feeling she's getting too old  
A person  
Can develop  
A bad, bad cold!

While it's resting on pillows of sky  
Deep in your arms, it's peaceful and warm  
Together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm  
In a moment or two, we can hear the stars coming through  
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you  
  
After the rain, the birds want to fly  
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry  
Like puddles and pools, what your eyes let me see  
Are their loving reflections of me  
After a while, you touch me and then  
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again  
  
And then lost in a kiss,  
I could stay for hours like this  
Though i don't know just what magic the raindrops contain  
I know that everything's wonderful after the rain

Barbra Streisand,All That I Want,/b/barbra+streisand/all+that+i+want_20013001.html,"I want a gown of diamonds  
Long gloves and sweet perfumes  
Hats made of silks and satins  
Seaqueens and ostrich plums  
I want to wear mascara  
Polish my nails real bright  
I want to be an actress  
Actresses play all night  
If I should sneeze it's a sign  
All that I want to will be mine  
Oh please, pretty, please  
Dear nose make me sneeze  
I want to find my true love  
Like all the love songs say  
I want to do what I want  
I want to get my way  
Wild dreams grow wise  
When sweet childhood flies  
Time waved a hand  
And the breeze blue the sand from my eyes  
I want a gown of kingdom  
Diamonds would weigh me down  
Pompoms and plums are pretty  
If you're a circus clown  
Funny how black mascara  
Streaks when the tears begin  
Nail polish, rouge and powder  
Can't paint the sparkle in  
Once I was slaved to a sneeze  
Now sneezing is just a disease  
A rose is a rose  
And a nose just a nose  
True love's a phrase for love songs  
Real love's a leaving thing  
I want the love worth living  
I want the things I sing  
I want the love worth living  
I want the things I sing

What did I long for I never really knew  
Finding your love I found my adventure  
Touching your hand my heart beats the faster

... You are the promised kiss of springtime  
That makes the lonely winter seem long  
You are the breathless hush of evening  
That trembles on the brink  
Of a lovely song  
  
You are the angel glow that lights a star  
The dearest things I've known are what you are  
Someday my happy arms will hold  
And someday I'll know that moment divine  
When all the things you are, are mine

And someday I'll know that moment divine

In a towel when you're wet

From the hills, from the shore  
Ride the wind to my door  
Turn the high with the dust  
Break the law if you must  
Move the world, only just come back to me  
  
Blast you high, hear me call  
Must i fight city hall  
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me  
What on earth must i do  
Scream and yell till i'm blue  
Curse your soul when will you come back to me?  
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon  
At your rack, at your room  
Mademoiselle, where in hell can you be?

Out to lunch ever more  
In a royce or a van, wrapped in mink coats or rain

Feel the waves on your skin  
Like a call from within, come back to me  
Leave behind all your own  
Tell your flowers you will phone  
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me  
  
Let your tub overflow

Let him wait for godot  
By the rail,  
Come by mail, cod  
Par avion, par bateau  
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux  
  
Come by steam, come by gas  
Call for free on a pass  
On the drags and the glass, come back to me  
Leave your bills all unpaid  
Let your bed go unmade  
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me  
Come by sail, come by freight  
In a box or a tray, keep your head on the plate  
I don't care this is where you should be  
  
Come in pain or in joy

In a bag or a trunk (shut up!)

Make the music weave a spell  
Whirl away your worry  
Things look almost twice as well  
When you're slightly blurry  
As around and around you go  
Your spirits will hit the top  
And now that we're dancing  
Who cares if we ever stop  
One-two-three  
One-two-three  
One-two  
And now that we're dancing  
Who cares if we ever stop!

There I am reaching for you  
Longing to turn to you  
That's all I want oh so much  
Deep in the night I need you  
To touch me  
Deep in the night, I wait for daylight  
Daytimes I always get through  
But when the sun goes down  
That's when I feel  
I feel oh so alone  
Deep in the night I need you  
To hold me  
Read a book and I think about you  
Put it down and I think about you  
I make some coffee and I think about you  
Wash up the cup and I think about you  
Wind the clock and I think about you  
Turn on the light and I think about you  
When I punch the pillow and I think about you  
Deep in the night I feel lonely  
Why didn't I try someone new?  
It didn't work out I know  
But I know but I know  
Because I try I try  
Deep in the night  
I need you beside me  
Deep deep in the night

No tears to cry  
With you I have it all  
  
If love can never die  
I'm not afraid to fly  
But how far must I fall  
  
One silver song  
One lullaby  
For all the love we make  
  
It's the look in your eyes  
It's the moon on the rise  
It's the sound of the heart  
That you break  
  
Gone is the dark of night  
Call on the early glow  
Send down the birds of love  
That circle us below  
  
And still I will hunger for  
You whispering, ""Mi amor""  
Over the ocean's roar  
And your arms reach for me  
  
And the shine on the sea  
And the night will become  
Our golden dawn

How long? A year, a day?

Here now, next to me, and worlds away!  
See I free you, and I'll see you when I see you,  
Fine, ok?  
Goodbye for now, again  
Goodbye until whenever then  
We're free, that's what we said we'd be,  
At leave to come an' go, you as well as I,

For now

I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies  
Well I'm all grown up now  
Can you still help somehow  
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream  
So here's my lifelong wish  
My grown-up X-mas list  
Not for myself but for a world in need  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
Every man would have a friend  
That right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grown-up Christmas list  
What is this illusion called  
The innocence of youth  
Maybe only in that blind belief  
Can we ever find the truth  
There'd be no more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And every man would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grow-up X-mas list  
This is my only life-long wish  
This is my grown-up X-mas list....

That we be led astray, the wonder of desire  
To love the things we cannot touch

And for a time, we fall in love with someone
